In a summary of its World Agriculture Report, the department said grain production in sub-Saharan Africa was a record high in 1986, with gains in almost every country.     However, food needs in Central America rose, worsened by drought-reduced crops and civil strife.     Record wheat production in 1986/87 is pushing global wheat consumption for food to a new high, and higher yielding varieties have been particularly effective where spring wheat is a common crop, it said.     However, may developing countries in tropical climates, such as Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central America, are not well adapted for wheat production, and improved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs, the department said.     World per capita consumption of vegetable oil will rise in 1986/87 for the third straight year.     Soybean oil constitutes almost 30 pct of vegetable oil consumption, while palm oil is the most traded, the department said.  Reuter '},\n",

              "  'TITLE': 'U.S. SUGAR PROGRAM CUT SENT TO CONGRESS BY USDA',\n",
              "  'BODY': 'The U.S. Agriculture Department  formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal to drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers for the cut with targeted income payments.     In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying the \"Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987\", Peter Myers, Deputy Agriculture Secretary, said the Reagan administration wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning with the 1987 crop, down from 18 cts now.     Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the government for the price support cut with targeted income payments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments would cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs, Myers said.     The administration sugar proposal is expected to be introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep. John Porter, R-Ill.     Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because politically-influential sugar and corn growers and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.     The direct payment plan outlined by the administration  targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually lowers payments over four years. It also excludes from payment any output exceeding 20,000 short tons raw sugar per grower.     For example, on the first 350 tons of production, a grower would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988, 4.5 cts in 1989, 3 cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.     The income payments would be based on the amount of commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985 or 1986 crop years, whichever is less, USDA said.     Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes in the sugar program because the current high price support is causing adverse trends in the sugar industry.     He said the current program has artificially stimulated domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed corn sweeteners to make market inroads.     U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a \"progressive contraction\" of the sugar import quota to only one mln short tons this year, he said. This has hurt cane sugar refiners who rely on imported sugar processing.     Furthermore, USDA said the current sugar program gives overseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a competitive advantage. The result has been higher imports of sugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processing facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar.     USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on U.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987, USDA said consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than necessary for sugar.     \"Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently facing,\" Myers said.     The following table lists the rate of payments, in cts per lb, to growers and the quantity covered, in short tons recoverable raw sugar, under the administration\\'s proposal to compensate sugar growers with targeted payments.

              "  'BODY': 'The USDA monthly cold storage report for meats is expected to have little, if any, effect on livestock and meat futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Monday and daily fundamentals will likely provide the bulk of direction, livestock analysts said.     The increase of 66.4 mln lbs in total poultry offsets the 22.6 mln lbs decline in total red meats. Fundamentals may provide most of the direction in futures on Monday, they said.     \"I think the market is going to be looking at some other things and accentuate whatever the action of cash markets might be early next week,\" Jerry Gidel, livestock analyst for GH Miller, said.     Shearson Lehman livestock analyst Chuck Levitt said futures will be in the shadow of a little larger seasonal hog marketings pace next week. Also, Easter ham business was completed this week and there may be less aggressive interest for pork in general next week.     \"We needed some help from the cold storage report to avert a possible setback next week in the pork complex,\" Levitt said.     Analysts agreed with CME floor traders and called the belly figure neutral to slightly negative. Although belly stocks were down 33 pct from last year, they exceeded the average expectation and actually showed a lighter than expected decline from last month due to an adjustment to last month\\'s holdings, they said.     However, analysts noted that the amount of bellies put in storage has been light since the beginning of March and this is a potentially bullish situation.     Glenn Grimes, agronomist at the University of Missouri, said, \"I would not look for (belly) storage during the next month or two to be heavier than a year ago - I think it will be less.\"  Reuter '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'The St. Lawrence Seaway, set to reopen March 31 after the winter, faces another tough year because of depressed traffic levels and the possibility of the first strike in 20 years on the Great Lakes, seaway officials said.     Depressed grain exports, rising costs, and competing modes of transportation are all expected to result in only a marginal increase over last year\\'s traffic levels -- and revenues -- on the 2,300 mile waterway, officials said.     In 1986, a season that ran from April 3 to December 27, the seaway moved 37.6 mln metric tons of freight between Montreal and Lake Ontario and 41.6 mln tons on the Welland Canal, linking Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.     By comparison, in 1985 about 37 mln tons of cargo traveled through the Montreal-Lake Ontario section and 42 mln through the eight-lock canal.     The waterway is expected to lose 9-10 mln Canadian dlrs this year, about the same as the estimated deficit for fiscal 1986-87 ending March 31, said William Blair, an executive member of Canada\\'s St Lawrence Seaway Authority.     The seaway moves about one-half of Canada\\'s exported grain. Those exports of the single most important commodity carried on the waterway have been depressed by world surpluses.     The Seafarers\\' International Union, which represents about 2,300 workers on the Great Lakes and the ocean coasts, has said it will likely go on strike this spring to protest employers\\' demands for wage rollbacks and other concessions.     \"It\\'s 99.9 pct (certain)--I guarantee you a strike,\" Roman Gralewicz, head of the Seafarers\\' Canadian branch, has said.     The Canadian government has called in a labor conciliator to try to hammer out a contract agreement between the two sides. The seaway authority said a walkout tying up ships on the Great Lakes would badly hurt traffic.     \"We haven\\'t had a strike on the seaway for years...a prolonged strike would have a disasterous effect,\" Seaway Authority spokeswoman Gay Hemsley said.     \"These are the heaviest contract talks in the history of the St Lawrence Seaway,\" George Miller, vice-president of the Canadian Lake Carriers Association, an association of major Canadian shipping companies, said recently.     The workers\\' current contract expires May 31. The association said it is asking for a five per cent cut in wages for the next three years, reduced crew levels and the power to restructure crew dispatching.     The association said its members recorded about a 6 mln dlrs (U.S.) loss in each of 1985 and 1986 due to lower traffic and freight rates and increasing competition. The seaway said 1985 was its worst year in two decades.     Hemsley said the seaway authority plans to raise tolls on the Welland Canal by eight pct this year, compared to last year\\'s 15 pct rise, while maintaining a freeze on tolls throughout the rest of the waterway.     Canada is responsible for 13 of the seaway\\'s 15 locks and about 85 pct of its revenues and maintenance costs.     \"We may see and hope for a steady upward climb...but we won\\'t see a major increase for a number of years,\" Hemsley said.     A Canada-U.S. delegation to promote the seaway to shippers in Western Europe should result in some increased traffic this season but the full benefits won\\'t be felt for several years, Blair said.

              "  'BODY': 'Trade is the most urgent problem facing U.S.-Canadian relations because of a pressing need to reach a new bilateral pact within the coming months, Joe Clark, Canadian secretary of state for external affairs, said.     Negotiators for the two countries have been meeting for more than a year in an effort to work out an agreement.     \"The most urgent problem now is the trade question because that has to be decided within the next 10 months,\" Clark told the Commonwealth Club of California. \"We have a fast track authority from your Congress for approval or rejection of whatever the negotiators achieve.\"     Clark said that, as a practical matter, an initial agreement must be reached by late September or early October.     He listed environmental questions, particularly acid rain, and defense as the second and third most important bilateral issues facing Ottawa and Washington.     On Wednesday, President Reagan announced that he will seek 2.5 billion dlrs from Congress to address the acid rain problem. Some interpreted the move as a goodwill gesture in advance of his annual meeting, on April 5-6 in Ottawa, with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.     In a question-and-answer session with the public affairs group, Clark said that the two countries must find better mechanisms for resolving their trade disputes.     \"This rash of countervailing actions, where we acted on corn and you acted on soft wood and we both said they were quasijudicial -- the dispute resolution mechanisims in place now are not working adequately in either of our interests,\" he said.     Ottawa also is seeking to change some of Washington\\'s rules on government procurement that penalize Canadian businesses, he said.     \"There are a number of Canadian companies that, in order to secure substantial contracts in the United States, have had to move their head offices out of our country into your country because you have national procurement requirements,\" he said.     In turn, he added, the United States would like to change some of the procurement requirements that exist at the provincial government level in Canada.     Clark declined to forecast the outcome of the discussions.     \"What will come out of it remains for the negotiators, in the first instance, to propose, and then governments and congresses will have judge,\" he said.     In his prepared remarks, Clark said that the United States has tended to take Canada for granted, although it exports to its northern neighbor more than twice what it exports to Japan. \"Yet you bought almost 10 per cent more from Japan last year than you bought from Canada,\" he said.

              "  'TITLE': 'NATURAL GAS SEEN RECAPTURING SOME MARKET SHARE',\n",
              "  'BODY': 'Higher crude oil prices will raise demand for natural gas, helping it to reclaim market share lost to heavy oil when prices plunged in 1986, analysts said.     The analysts said that these efforts will be most successful in the industrial sectors of the economy with large and growing energy requirements.     \"Natural gas stands a good chance to recapture the share of oil supplied to electric utilities that it lost to the residual fuel industry last year,\" Michael Smolinski, an energy economist with Data Resources Inc, told Reuters.     An estimated 200,000 barrels per day of residual fuel went into the utilities market at the expense of natural gas last year when world oil prices plunged, Smolinski said.      Assuming oil prices hold above 15 dlrs a barrel, national average gas prices delivered to the utilities at a projected 2.10 to 2.25 dlrs per mln Btu would be very competitive, Michael German, vice president of economic analysis at American Gas Association said.     The average delivered prices at the end of January were 2.10 dlrs per mln Btu, compared with 3.26 dlrs a year ago.     \"We expect natural gas to regain 250 to 400 billion cubic feet (of demand) in the overall energy market in the second and third quarter (1987),\" he said.     In addition to price competitiveness, availability will be an important factor persuading energy users to switch to gas, Frank Spadine, senior energy economist with Bankers Trust Corp. in New York noted.     Spadine said the mild winter in many parts of the North American continent has led to a build up of gas inventories and less would be necessary to replenish underground storage this spring freeing gas for spot sales.     These forecasts develop a strong counterpoint to the fears that natural gas suplies would be tight and prices significantly higher given a sharp decline in drilling last year.     AGA\\'s German contended that despite the drilling decline, much of U.S. proved reserves could be brought to production quickly through developments such as the infill drilling which permits more wells to be drilled in proved reserve basins.     Citing recent EIA statistics, German said, the gas surplus was likely to contract from three trillion cubic feet in 1986 to two trillion cubic feet in 1987, but the surplus would not go away until 1990.     Smolinski of Data Resources agreed that the surplus would persist until 1990. While gas supplies may tighten in certain consuming areas, notably in California and in the Northeast U.S., an overall shortfall appeared remote.  Reuter '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'The United States will likely impose sanctions soon on imports of Japanese microchips, senators said today after a private meeting with Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige.     Although the senators said Baldrige told them no decision would be taken until a final determination is made on whether Japanese microchips were dumped in the United States, they said they were virtually sure Japan would face penalties.     President Reagan\\'s trade policy advisory group, of which Baldrige is a member, will meet on the issue Wednesday.     \"I am confident we will see action taken,\" Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican, told reporters.     \"I am expecting sanctions at least, and even more than sanctions,\" Sen. Pete Domenici, a New Mexico Republican, said.     The senators, several congressmen and U.S. semiconductor industry representatives met with Baldrige and State Department officials to discuss Japan\\'s alleged violations of a September 1986 agreement to stop dumping its microchips in the United States and other countries.     They recommended Japanese firms be penalized through tariffs or import duties over the next six to 12 months for continuing to dump microchips. The violations were worth 100 mln dls to the Japanese semiconductor industry, they said.     Asked if Baldrige intended to recommend sanctions, Sen. Pete Wilson told reporters, \"The clear import of what he said is that there will be.\"     \"Japan can\\'t just say they will comply. We think sanctions must be applied,\" for past violations of the agreement, the California Republican said.     The semiconductor industry produces microprocessor chips which are used in high technology products ranging from radios to defence missile guidance systems.     Sen. James McClure, an Idaho Republican, said Baldrige told them the administration had not made a final determination that Japanese companies had dumped semiconductor microchips below the cost of production in the United States or other countries.     But McClure said senators told him, \"There is no doubt dumping is going on,\" based on evidence such as invoices of purchases of the Japanese products.     The two countries signed a pact last September in which Japan agreed to stop selling its microchips in the United States and other countries below production costs and to allow the U.S. semiconductor industry access to the Japanese market.     In return, the United States waived its right to impose import duties on the Japanese microchips.     Japanese officials have said they have lived up to the pact and have asked Japanese chip-makers to further slash output to save the pact.     Japan has frequently been the target of congressional discouragement over last year\\'s record 169-billion-dlr trade deficit. Tokyo had a 59-billion-dlr surplus with the United States last year and had large surpluses with other countries.     The Senate yesterday unanimously passed a resolution calling for action against Japan for violations of the pact since September. The resolution will be introduced in the House next week by Rep. Bob Matsui, a California Democrat.  Reuter '},\n",

              "  'BODY': \"Bolivia, once Latin America's most delinquent debtor, is preparing for a second International Monetary Fund agreement after an economic stabilisation program has effectively slowed inflation and reduced public spending.     A fund spokesman said an IMF team would visit La Paz shortly to discuss terms of the new agreement.     He said the IMF had disbursed 130 mln dlrs here and 20 mln dlrs are pending under the one year agreement that ends this month. The accord provided for a stand-by loan, a compensatory financing facility and a structural adjustment facility.     The spokesman said that if the agreement is renewed, Bolivia can expect a further 60-mln-dlr stand-by loan over the next 12 months.     Bolivia's agreement with the IMF, its first since 1980, opened the door to rescheduling negotiations with the Paris Club and Argentina and Brazil, which hold 2.5 billion dlrs of Bolivia's 4.0-billion-dlr foreign debt.     Central Bank President Javier Nogales told Reuters the negotiations with the Paris Club, which have yet to be finalised, had been extremely successful.     Nogales said the Paris Club had agreed to reschedule Bolivia's debt over 10 years with five to six years grace and had waived all interest payments until the end of 1988.     Bilateral discussions on interest rates continue, he said.     Nogales said Bolivia was expecting some 400 mln dlrs in disbursements this year from lender countries and international agencies, including the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, although diplomatic and banking sources put the figure at closer to 300 mln dlrs.     Nogales said Bolivia's net international reserves are around 250 mln dlrs, up from one mln dlrs when President Ictor Paz Estenssoro took office in august 1985. Nogales said the capital flow on Bolivia's debt servicing versus new credits had changed from a net outflow of 200 mln dlrs in 1985 to a net inflow of 130 mln dlrs in 1986.     Bolivia's return from the financial wilderness follows paz estenssoro's economic stabilisation program. He inherited inflation of 23,000 pct a year, state enterprises that were losing hundreds of mlns of dlrs and a currency that traded on the black market at up to 16 times its official rate.     Paz estenssoro froze public sector wages, set a market- related rate for the peso, introduced tax reforms and laid off thousands of workers in state corporations.     Inflation has been running at 10 pct a year for the past six months, according to the Central Bank, and the government  expects the economy to grow three pct this year after a 14 pct contraction over the last six years.     The government is also proposing a novel solution to its debt to commercial banks, some 900 mln dlrs, on which interest has not been paid since March, 1984.     Nogales said that over the next few months Bolivia would make a one-time offer to buy back all its commercial debt at the price it trades on the international secondary market --  10-15 cents on the dlr. He said Bolivia's commercial bank steering committee agreed at a meeting in New York to consider the proposal, but it is still unclear what proportion of the country's creditor banks will take up the offer.     One foreign banker speculated that Bolivia might be able to buy back up to 30 pct of its commercial debt paper under the deal, mostly from small banks who have written off their loans to the country.     But he said the larger creditors were more interested in a scheme of debt-equity swaps, similar to that which has operated in Chile for the past two years.     The Bolivian government has yet to draw up proposals for debt-equity swaps, but the banker said it was planning to privatise more than 100 state companies and these could serve as a basis for such a scheme.     Foreign bankers said this type of proposal might prove attractive to Bolivia in the long run, especially as the government realises that it will have to attract a large amount of new capital in order to grow.     Planning Minister Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada told Reuters that Bolivia was hoping for five to six billion dlrs in new investment over the next 10 to 12 years.     The government realises that in order to remain viable, Bolivia will need to develop new exports.     The price of tin, which accounted for some 45 pct of Bolivia's exports in 1984, has collapsed on the world markets, and gas, the country's major revenue earner, is in abundant supply in the region.

              "  'BODY': 'The new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), like the 1979 pact, will use a buffer stock as the sole instrument for market intervention -- excluding export quotas or production controls.     The new INRA was adopted yesterday at a session held under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD).     In many respects the main features in the new pact resemble those contained in the present one.     The reference price, currently 201.66 Malaysian/Singapore cts per kilo, will be maintained -- unless between now and October 22, when the 1979 INRA expires, the average of the daily market indicator price remains above the upper intervention (\"may sell\") price (231 cts) or below the lower intervention (\"may buy\") price (171 cts) for six months.     If this happened -- but delegates said it was unlikely considering that the present indicator price averages 196 cts -- the price would be revised under the current accord by five pct or by whatever amount the International Natural Rubber Council decides.     The new reference price would then be taken over for the new agreement.     Under the same circumstances in the new pact the reference price would be automatically revised by five pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage.     Similarly, if buffer stock purchases or sales amounting to 300,000 tonnes have been made since the last revision, the reference price will be lowered or raised by three pct unless the Council decides on a higher percentage.     Another change introduced in the new INRA is that price reviews will be held at 15-month intervals instead of 18.     Those changes are intended to make the reference price more responsive to market trends.     As in the present accord the \"may buy\" and \"may sell\" levels are set at plus or minus 15 pct of the reference price, and the \"must buy\" and \"must sell\" levels at 20 pct of it.     The lower and upper indicative prices (floor and ceiling prices) will remain fixed at 150 and 270 cents, unless the Council decides to revise them at reviews held every 30 months.     During the negotiations, consumers abandoned a proposal that the floor price be adjusted downward if the buffer stock, currently 360,000 tonnes, rose to 450,000 tonnes.     The maximum size of the buffer stock in the new pact is the same as under the present one -- 400,000 tonnes, with provision for an additional contingency buffer stock of 150,000 tonnes.     Under the new accord, the contingency buffer stock will be brought in at 152 cts to defend the floor price.     At last Friday\\'s session, Ahmed Farouk, speaking for producers, said producing nations considered that the 1979 pact had served the purpose for which it had been created.     Gerard Guillonneau of France, who spoke for consumers, agreed that the current agreement had worked \"relatively well.\"     Asked about the chances of success of the new INRA, delegates noted that for nearly its whole life, the 1979 accord had maintained the average price above the \"must buy\" level.     They said the agreement until now did not appear to have encouraged excessive production of rubber.     In addition, provisions for borrowing to finance the buffer stock have now been eliminated, ruling out speculation. \"It is a sort of middle-of-the-road agreement,\" one delegate said.     The new pact will be open for signature at U.N. Headquarters in New York from May 1 to December 31 this year.     To become operational, it will require ratification by countries accounting for 75 pct of world exports and 75 pct of world imports.     Delegates estimate that this will take 12 to 14 months from now. During the hiatus between the two agreements, the International Natural Rubber Council will remain in place.     The pact will enter into force definitively when governments accounting for 80 pct of world exports and 80 pct of world imports have ratified it.  REUTER '},\n",

It was the second consecutive monthly fall, after dropping nine pct in January, but it was still 26.49 pct up on February 1986 following a very extended rise last year.     The January figure was revised from a preliminary 154.82.     A ministry official attributed the decline to falling production of non-metal products, textiles and transportation equipment, and less mining and house construction.     The official said the decline was also caused by falling exports in February due to the climb of the Taiwan dollar, which has made Taiwanese products more expensive.     He expected the decline to continue in the next few months because of further appreciation of the local dollar against the U.S. Currency.     The Taiwan dollar advanced more than 15 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985.

The case involving the Toyota Shoji Company was highlighted when its 32-year-old Chairman Kazuo Nagano was stabbed to death here in public view in June, 1985.     Television crews which had been waiting outside Nagano's home filmed two men smashing their way into the home and later emerging with a bloodstained bayonet.     The company, established here in 1981, undertook to hold gold on deposit for investors. It grew into a nationwide business operation with 87 branch offices and 7,000 employees at its peak in early 1985.     Toyota Shoji's business group collected an estimated 200 billion yen from about 30,000 clients, many of them pensioners and housewives, before the firm went bankrupt in July, 1985, according to lawyers.

              "  'BODY': 'World Bank President Barber Conable is expected to press Indonesia, the Third World\\'s sixth largest debtor, to maintain the momentum of economic policy changes to tackle the slump in its oil revenues, western diplomats said.     Conable, who flew to Indonesia yesterday from Tokyo, will meet with President Suharto and senior economic ministers.     He said on arrival that the economy of South-East Asia\\'s largest nation was being managed well, but the slump in world oil prices called for major policy adjustments.     Today the World Bank chief will visit Bank-funded projects in the eastern section of Java, Indonesia\\'s most populous island. He will see Suharto on Tuesday after a day of detailed discussions with ministers tomorrow.     Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC, has been severely hit by last year\\'s crash in oil prices, which cut its oil and gas revenues in half.     Japan\\'s state Export-Import Bank last month agreed to provide around 900 mln dlrs in untied credits to help Indonesia pay for its share of 21 World Bank development projects.     Indonesia, a country of 168 mln people, has responded to the oil slump by cutting spending, devaluing its currency by 31 pct, and trying to boost exports, while using foreign loans to bridge its deficit.     Diplomats said that Conable was expected to press Suharto and leading economic ministers to maintain the pace of policy change, particularly in dismantling Indonesia\\'s high-cost protected economy.     \"Oil prices, the debt crisis, the world recession, all call for major policy adjustments and external support,\" Conable said in his arrival statement.     But with Indonesia facing parliamentary elections next month, he is likely to avoid anything which would imply that the Bank is demanding specific changes.     \"We believe there has been wise leadership here and the economy is being very well managed,\" Conable told reporters at Jakarta airport.     Indonesia has official and private overseas debts totalling 37 billion dlrs, according to the Bank, which makes it the Third World\\'s sixth biggest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank since 1968.     Conable did not spell out what further changes he would like to see. Last month the Bank endorsed economic changes already introduced by Indonesia, but implied it wanted more.     Giving a 300 mln dlr loan in balance of payments support, the Bank said it will monitor progress on implementation of the government\\'s trade reform measures, and supported its determination to promote efficiency and longer-term growth.     Indonesia has introduced a series of measures since last May to boost non-oil exports, liberalise trade and encourage outside investment.     Suharto has also ordered a government committee to look into which of Indonesia\\'s 215 state-run companies could be sold.     But in a report last month, the U.S. Embassy said the government appeared divided over how far to take its reforms.     Western analysts say that in particular the government is unsure how far to go with dismantling Indonesia\\'s high-cost monopolies, which control core areas of the economy.     Central bank governor Arifin Siregar said this week that Indonesia faced very limited economic choices.     It could not spend its way out of trouble because this would increase the balance of payments deficit and domestic inflation.      He said the main objective was to raise exports outside the oil and natural gas sector.     Indonesia\\'s current account deficit is projected by the government to fall to 2.64 billion dlrs in the coming financial year which starts on April 1, from an estimated 4.1 billion in 1986/87.

              "  'BODY': 'Nigeria\\'s Central Bank has changed the rules governing its foreign exchange auctions in what analysts see as a means of defending the naira currency, which has depreciated steadily.     The bank said in a statement that from April 2, banks bidding for foreign exchange would have to pay at the rate they offered and not, as presently, at the rate of the lowest successful bid made at the auction.     This should discourage banks from bidding high to ensure that they were successful while paying the lower \"marginal\" rate, analysts said.     \"It should act as a brake because banks will know that if they bid high they will have to pay what they offered,\" a Western diplomat commented.     The naira has depreciated against the dollar by 62 pct since the auctions, known as the Second-Tier Foreign Exchange Market (SFEM), began last September 26.     At last week\\'s session the Nigerian currency was fixed at 4.0 to the dollar, the third fall in a row.     \"They were clearly worried... And this is the logical way of trying to stop the trend,\" the diplomat said.     The Central Bank also announced the auctions would be fortnightly, not weekly, beginning on April 2.     It was not immediately clear whether next Thursday\\'s scheduled session would still take place, nor if the bank was planning to double the 50 mln dlrs which are normally on offer at each auction.     Demand for foreign exchange has consistently outstripped supply, encouraging banks to bid high and thus further weakening the naira.     If the normal weekly allocation is not doubled at the fortnightly session, high demand could undermine the objective of the new system, analysts said.     Although bidding banks will now pay what they offered, the official exchange rate for the naira applying to business transactions will continue to be the marginal rate -- the lowest successful bid.     SFEM is a central part of Nigeria\\'s structural adjustment program, which is considered to be the most ambitious economic recovery plan in Black Africa.     The program involves setting a realistic exchange rate for the naira, which was over-valued for many years, liberalising imports, boosting agriculture, removing subsidies and reducing inefficient government participation in the economy.     The World Bank has played a prominent part in designing this dramatic blue-print and in selling it to an often sceptical public which fears inflation and lower living standards.     Ishrat Husain, the World Bank\\'s representative in Nigeria, said yesterday he was satisfied both with the adjustment program as a whole and the foreign exchange auctions.     \"So far so good\" he told a meeting of bankers in Lagos, adding that only members of Nigeria\\'s import-dependent elite would suffer hardship while the common man would benefit.     Fears that the program would encourage inflation were incorrect, he said.     Bumper harvests had reduced rural inflation and urban prices had already reflected the naira\\'s black market value before the currency was allowed to find its true level last September.

              "  'BODY': 'Brazil\\'s attempt to seek better terms for paying off its 109 billion dlr foreign debt is responsible and modest, a former chairman of President Reagan\\'s Council of Economic Advisers said.     \"I think that what Brazil is calling for -- limiting its debt payments to two and one half pct of GNP -- is a responsible request on their part,\" economist Martin Feldstein said at a news conference.     \"It requires additional money on the part of the banks, but rather modest additional amounts.\"     Feldstein is attending the annual meeting of the Trilateral Commission, a foreign policy group of more than 300 business and government leaders from North America, Europe and Japan.     Feldstein, one of four members of a task force on Third World debt, said that Brazil\\'s request would mean an additional credit of three billion to four billion dlrs from banks and international agencies.     \"Brazil\\'s debt would increase in dollar terms but remain constant in real terms. The four billion dlr increase in Brazil\\'s 100 billion dlr debt would represent no increase in the real inflation-adjusted size of its liability,\" he said.     Feldstein said he believed current Third World debt problems were less serious than those faced by the international monetary system in 1983 and 1985.     However, the European representative on the task force, Herve de Carmoy, chief executive international for Midland Bank PLC, disagreed.     He called the present situation more difficult and, in a draft proposal included in the task force\\'s report, suggested setting up an institution, possibly within the World Bank, with a fund that could deal with a future debt crisis.     Commission discussions were closed to reporters but it was apparent from the news conference that task force members did not agree on all points in their report.     One point of agreement, Feldstein said, was that debtor countries would need additional credit in the coming years if they are to enjoy satisfactory growth.     Feldstein said the task force, which also included Koei Narusawa, economic adviser to the president of the Bank of Toyko, and Paul Krugman, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, did not agree on how much credit would be needed.     He said they also did not reach a consensus on how willing international banks, particularly those in Japan and Europe, would be to lend the money.     The Trilateral Commission was set up in 1973 by David Rockefeller, former head of Chase Manhattan bank, and others to promote closer cooperation among the three regions.  REUTER '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'President Jose Sarney, whose handling of the economy is under attack at home and abroad, has held private talks with Brazilian business leaders worried that government policies are leading to recession.     Over an informal barbecue at a farm outside Sao Paulo owned by millionaire entrepreneur Matias Machline, Sarney met more than 20 businessmen for discussion on Brazil\\'s economic crisis.     Business leaders said before the meeting they would be pressing for less government interference in what they describe as a tightly regulated economy.     Their concerns include the country\\'s high rates of interest and tough restrictions on imports.     Machline, president of the Sharp electronics group and a personal friend of Sarney\\'s, told television reporters outside his farm that he wanted \"less government participation in the economy.\"     When the government announced a month ago that it was suspending interest payments on Brazil\\'s 68 billion dlr debt to commercial banks, it said this was a means of ensuring growth and avoiding recession.     But business leaders and economic analysts say there are growing signs that Brazil\\'s economy, the eighth biggest in the non-communist world, is heading for a downturn after 8 pct growth last year.     Businessmen are deeply concerned about the effect on industry of import restrictions introduced earlier this year because of the country\\'s deteriorating trade balance.     Cacex, the foreign trade department of the federally owned Banco do Brasil, has told companies they must limit their imports to 90 pct of what they imported in 1985.     Business sources say that in practice importing even this amount is difficult and they have to haggle with Cacex on a case-by-case basis.     The business daily Gazeta Mercantil reported that in many sectors of the economy there was a real fear that production lines would grind to a halt next month.     One of those attending the talks was Mario Amato, head of the powerful Sao Paulo State Industries\\' Federation (FIESP).     Business sources said he would argue that unless there were a relaxation in import controls a sharp downturn in industrial activity was inevitable.     Relations between Sarney and the business community have at times been strained and the existence of these tensions pointed up the importance of the meeting.     In one bizarre dispute in January, Sarney surprised Brazilian business leaders by declaring that they were allies of the 19th century anarchist Mikhail Bakunin. This outburst came after Amato warned that companies might start disobeying government regulations on price controls.     Brazilian press reports made much of the fact that Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, chief architect of the government\\'s economic policy, had not been invited to the gathering.  REUTER '},\n",

Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which must not be sidetracked.     \"We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world trading system,\" he said.     \"We have seen that the failure of the world trading system has caused great depression and conflict in the past. Our failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us all,\" Moore said.     He added: \"The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is our last hope and best opportunity this century. We will not get another chance before the year 2000.\"     The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade since the \"Uruguay round\" talks last Sepember. The meeting is also part of preparations for a full-scale conference of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice in June.     The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have been particularly successful, with northern hemisphere countries managing to have service industries such as banking and insurance included in the next full round.     The southerners\\' goal of including agricultural and tropical products also was met.     The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is described by participants as informal and no declaration is expected.     Moore said one aim was to \"instil a sense of political urgency to avert potential economic tragedy.\"     Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the benefits, as well as preventing \"bush fires of confrontation while we proceed with orderly negotiations.\"     The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community.     The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.     American sources say he is ready to state that the best way to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to implement four key Uruguay proposals:     -- an end to agricultural subsidies;     -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT regulations;     -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called intellectual property such as trademarks, patents and copyrights;     -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT\\'s 92 member states.     Earlier, New Zealand sources had said French Foreign Trade Minister Michel Noir had pulled out of the informal GATT talks for domestic political reasons.

              "  'BODY': 'A hefty slice of new U.S. Treasury supply is not the most welcome prospect for a slumbering credit market, but at least this week\\'s offerings should provide it with some focus, economists said.     \"Banks and mutual funds have cash that should be put to work, so the auctions should breathe some life into the market,\" said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.     The Treasury will place a 25 billion dlr package of two-year, four-year and seven-year notes on the sales block this week.     The \"mini-refunding,\" which will raise 9.27 billion dlrs in new cash, comprises 10 billion dlrs of two-year notes for auction on Tuesday, 7.75 billion dlrs of four-year notes on Wednesday and 7.25 billion dlrs of seven-year notes on Thursday. The market also faces the regular weekly three- and six-month bill auction today, amounting to 12.8 billion dlrs.     The mini-refunding does not come at a particularly auspicious time for the market. Bond prices have been drifting sideways in a narrow range against the backdrop of a cloudy U.S. Economic outlook, diminished chances of a change in Federal Reserve Board policy and a stable dollar.     Moreover, the bond market\\'s inertia has compared unfavourably with the rash of activity taking place in high-yield markets overseas, like the U.K., As well as in U.S. Equities.     But according to the Merrill Lynch economists, there are signs the pall hanging over the U.S. Bond market is lifting a bit.     \"Customer activity has been light, but all on the buy-side, and there is a marked absence of selling,\" they said in a weekly report.     Philip Braverman of Irving Trust Securities Inc believes banks will snap up the two- and four-year issues at this week\\'s sales.     \"The banks are in need of investments that provide earnings. Though the yield spread to the cost of carrying these maturities has been wider, it is still positive,\" he said in a weekly market review.     But economists agreed not even the auctions will generate enough impetus for a major move. This will only come once the overseas markets have had their run.     \"Based on last week\\'s events, there is little to indicate that the appetite for yield has begun to wane,\" said economists at Salomon Brothers Inc.     Indeed, talk persisted last week that Japanese investors are planning to re-weight their portfolios in favour of the higher-yielding markets at the start of Japan\\'s new fiscal year on April 1.     And while traditionally the Japanese have not been big buyers of the shorter-dated issues on offer at this week\\'s U.S. Auctions, such reports undermine market confidence.     Even actions by the British, Australian and Canadian monetary authorities to curb the rise of their currencies should also enhance the attractiveness of their respective bond markets, the Salomon Brothers\\' economists said.     Meanwhile, ecomomic releases are unlikely to enliven the U.S. Market unless they deviate widely from expectations, economists said.     This week\\'s economic calendar begins on Tuesday with February durable goods orders. Economists expect a rebound from January\\'s depressed levels.     Peter Greenbaum of Smith, Barney, Harris Upham and Co said several areas, including transport equipment, should have bounced back. But a decline in military capital goods will cap total new orders. He forecasts a rise of two pct after January\\'s 6.7 pct slump. Some other economists foresee a gain as large as five pct.     Friday\\'s consumer price report for February is expected to show an increase of about 0.3 pct after a 0.7 pct January gain. Economists said energy prices -- the driving force behind the January rise -- rose more moderately last month, while food prices declined.     Meanwhile, economists warned that the federal funds rate will be subject to volatility in the weeks ahead due to the approach of quarter-end and the mid-April tax date.     Some economists expect the Fed to execute a bill pass this week because its adding requirement increases sharply in the new statement period beginning on Thursday.     Fed funds traded at 6-1/16 pct late Friday and are expected to open near that level.  REUTER '},\n",

European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world\\'s three major trading and economic powers -- the EC, the U.S. And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT.

After expecting improvements in two previous quarterly surveys, 56 pct of respondents reported working at less than satisfactory levels, with insufficient orders nominated by 70 pct as the major constraint.     Other constraints were capacity, 11 pct, and labour nine pct, the survey said.     Inflationary pressure increased during the quarter and investment plans for the next year were scaled down, which the survey said could limit activity in the medium to short term.     Respondents reporting an increase in orders fell to 22 pct in March from 30 pct in December, while those with orders accepted but not yet delivered fell to 14 pct from 21 pct.     Stocks of finished goods and raw materials fell sharply in the March quarter and further depletion was forecast for the June quarter, the survey said.     Respondents said finance was harder to obtain, which Westpac chief economist Bob Graham said was probably because of high interest rates rather than the availability of money.     Graham said he thought expectations would gradually improve later this year, when the dollar might consolidate and interest rates ease slightly.     He believed some manufacturers were not investing because they feared the Australian dollar would get stronger.     \"We do not believe the dollar will revalue, the (economic) fundamentals are for it to slip away if anything,\" he said.

Dart has said it would offer 41.75 dlrs cash for each SGL share if the SGL board recommended the offer to shareholders.     SGL has termed the 1.62 billion dlr offer unsolicited.     In a letter to SGL dated March 20, Dart also said it was denied confidential information on SGL that would be given to other potential bidders.     SGL officials could not be reached for comment.     Dart said it was advised that a selling brochure for the sale of SGL had been distributed to about 20 potential buyers, but not itself. These purchasers would also be given access to SGL\\'s books and records and the opportunity to talk with key employees.     \"We suspect that one or more of the 20 are leveraged buyout firms,\" said a source close to Dart. Analysts have said SGL management may be considering a leveraged buyout.     Dart said it remains interested in acquiring SGL on a friendly basis and reiterated its willingness to negotiate all the terms of its offer.     Dart said SGL representatives said the company has not received any other offer.     It said it requested the confidential information to better understand SGL, but was denied this because it refused to sign an agreement prohibiting it from making a bid for SGL without SGL\\'s approval.     The agreement would also have limited its ability to buy SGL shares, Dart said. It considered those conditions unreasonable in the interest of trying to negotiate a friendly transaction, it said.     Dart has just under five pct of SGL shares.     Dart said it requested the information before its meeting with SGL representatives, but held the meetings in the hope representatives would reach an agreement.     It said it indicated it was flexible on price, but was told there were certain issues important to SGL management and while they were not conditions to the deal, Dart was expected to take them into account in putting together its package.     It said the issues include an immediate payment of 5.7 mln dlrs to SGL chairman Leonard Lieberman, executive vice president James Dougherty and financial officer Murray Levine.     Dart said this payment was intended for the three officers\\' severance agreements, although there was an implication that Lieberman and Dougherty would be leaving the company of their own volition.     Dart said under their present agreements, none of these officers have any right to such accelerated payments. Also, Dart said Lieberman, Dougherty and Levine are to be paid 2.6 mln dlrs to pay their taxes. It also said top management\\'s incentive shares were to be accelerated and paid for at a cost of six mln dlrs although there are restrictions on the shares unless waived by the company\\'s compensation committee.     Dart said it was to fund up to five mln dlrs for top management\\'s supplemental retirement plan.     Dart said another issue was to agree to future severance obligations and future salary guarantees for top management, estimated at more than 15 mln dlrs in excess of obligations under the company\\'s present policy.     Dart said despite such management payments, it agreed to discuss all aspects of its offer and in fact did try to negotiate a transaction at the March 18 meeting with SGL.     Supermarkets General owns the Path Mark supermarket chain and Rickels home centres.     Dart also released a copy of a lawsuit that was being filed by an SGL shareholder, seeking to stop SGL from taking such actions as paying greenmail or enacting a poison pill defence.     The suit also sought to have directors carry out their fiduciary duty.     Greenmail is the payment at a premium for shares held by an unwanted suitor and a poison pill is typically the issue of securities to shareholders which make a takeover more expensive.

              "  'BODY': \"The government's over-reliance on revenue from crude oil is adversely affecting Australia's economic performance, Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) chairman Dennis Benbow said.     Over one-third of Australia's indirect tax income is derived from oil at a time of falling domestic output and weak crude prices, he told the APEA annual conference here.     This dependence on oil-generated revenue distorts the country's economic performance directly by acting as a disincentive to new exploration and indirectly by affecting trading competitiveness through high energy costs, he said.     Australia's medium-term liquid fuel self-sufficiency position is posing a major economic threat, yet the government's response has been to load new tax burdens on the oil industry, Benbow said.     Domestic oil output from existing fields is expected to fall to 280,000 barrels per day (bpd) in fiscal 1992/93 from 546,000 bpd in 1985/86, reflecting mainly the decline of the Bass Strait fields, he said.     Bass Strait reserves are now two-thirds depleted, with the three largest fields 80 pct depleted, he said.     By 1992/93, Bass Strait output is expected to be just over half the 1985/86 level, assuming a number of so far undeveloped fields are brought on stream and enhanced recovery from existing fields goes ahead, Benbow said.     Government projections of output from as yet undiscovered fields range from 40,000 to 130,000 bpd, he said.     Australian liquid fuel demand is forecast to rise to 680,000 bpd in 1992/93 from 565,000 in 1985/86, implying a crude oil gap of between 270,000 and 360,000 bpd in five years time, he said.     At present world oil prices and the current value of the Australian dollar, annual oil imports in 1992/93 would cost between 3.2 billion and 3.6 billion dlrs, Benbow said.     Despite intensive exploration in the early 1980's, the addition to reserves has been inadequate, he said.     For example, the 409 mln barrels discovered in the five years 1980-84 represent about two years' consumption, he said.

              "  'BODY': 'U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said any attempt to declare blanket debt forgiveness for major Latin American debtor nations might damage the world economy.     In an article in Monday\\'s edition of the Miami Herald, Baker also criticised the concept of short-term debt relief, calling it a \"dramatic, overnight solution.\"     \"While these ideas may be well-intentioned and have some political appeal, they are impractical and counterproductive in the long run,\" he said.     The article was published to coincide with a three-day meeting here of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB).     Baker is the chief architect of the U.S. Strategy on Third World debt.     Brazil, the Third World\\'s largest debtor, last month declared a moratorium on interest repayments. It has given no indication of when it may resume interest payments, prompting fears that some large U.S. Banks may be forced into substantial debt writedowns and calling into question the viability of the U.S. Strategy.     Baker, defending the strategy, said private commercial banks have rescheduled nearly 70 billion dlrs in debt since October 1985 at longer maturities and lower interest rates.     \"Together with expected progress in commercial bank discussions with Argentina and, we hope, Brazil, this should add up to substantial new lending for the major Latin debtors in 1987,\" Baker wrote.     He estimated that debt-equity conversion plans accounted for 2.5 billion dlrs last year in four of the region\\'s major debtor states. Such plans allow foreign bank creditors to sell Third World debt at a discount to investors who then become stockholders in firms in these countries. \"These swaps aren\\'t a panacea, but they do demonstrate how a creative free market can make progress in reducing the debt burden,\" he said.

              "  'BODY': 'Brazil wants to resume interest payments on its medium- and long-term foreign debt as soon as possible and is willing to discuss ways of softening the impact of the payments suspension on bank earnings, central bank governor Francisco Gros said.     Gros, speaking to reporters yesterday after his first meeting with Brazil\\'s bank advisory committee since he was appointed last month, also promised a clear statement of Brazil\\'s economic policy would be made in the next few days.     But bankers who attended the meeting with Gros said it was inconclusive.     The bankers also expressed disappointment Gros could not give assurances as to when interest payments on the 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt would restart.     \"It was all very tentative. You can\\'t expect to get very far at the first meeting,\" one banker said.     The meeting took place on the eve of the annual meeting here of the Inter-American Development Bank.     The most urgent item on yesterday\\'s agenda was the need for a legal rollover of some 16 billion dlrs in trade and interbank credit lines extended to Brazilian banks which expire at the end of March.     Brazil has already frozen the lines to ensure it has enough credit to finance its day-to-day trade and commerce, but needs to request a formal extension of the commitments to head off possible lawsuits from disgruntled creditors.     The issue is whether the 14-bank steering committee will endorse Brazil\\'s request to the 700 creditor banks worldwide or simply relay it without comment.     This delicate question was not resolved at yesterday\\'s meeting, but lawyers from both sides will try to draft suitable language for a telex by midweek, Gros and the bankers said.     Gros said he will also formally ask the banks for a 90-day rollover of some 9.6 billion dlrs of debt which originally matured in 1986 and is now due to be repaid on April 15. Bankers said the request is a legal nicety since the money is subject to the moratorium.     Once interest on Brazil\\'s debts becomes more than 90 days overdue, U.S. And Canadian banks must put the loans on non-performing basis and may book payments only as and when they are received instead of accruing the interest in advance.     Citicorp has estimated its profits for the first quarter would be cut by 50 mln dlrs if it put Brazil on a cash basis. Other U.S. Banks have also warned of earnings setbacks.     Gros said he wished the 90-day rule was more flexible and said he would be willing to sit down with the banks to see if there was a way round the problem.     He did not elaborate. But, asked whether a bridge loan might be arranged to pay the interest, he said, \"It could happen.\"     Bankers said this possibility had not been raised at the committee meeting and dismissed it as inconsistent with Brazil\\'s determination to find a long-term solution to the problem of servicing its 110 billion dlr foreign debt.     Gros himself said pushing the problem away for 90 days at a time is not very useful. Only if Brazil has access to new loans can it grow, export and pay its debts over the longer term.     \"If the flow of funds dries up, a country like Brazil can\\'t meet all its obligations,\" he said.     Gros defended Brazil\\'s recent economic record, noting inflation slowed in February, the trade surplus rose and the public sector budget was in operational surplus.     But he said there was a need to spell out government policy, especially on prices.     \"It\\'s necessary to clarify policy for internal and external reasons,\" he said, but declined to say what economic measures might be introduced.

              "  'BODY': 'Controversy surrounding U.S.-backed reforms in the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) underscores the mounting challenge to Washington\\'s current debt strategy, according to Latin American officials and delegates to the IADB meeting that begins here today.     The bank\\'s policy-making board on Saturday postponed a decision on the reforms until June in view of strong Latin American opposition to U.S. Proposals to strengthen its control over lending to the region.     Washington wants to involve the IADB in its debt strategy through increased lending, but as the bank\\'s largest single shareholder it also wants to require countries to adopt far-reaching economic reforms to qualify for loans.     The U.S. Push for IADB reforms, which began at last year\\'s meeting in Costa Rica, is particularly sensitive in an institution Latin Americans have traditionally thought of as their own.     \"It\\'s almost an issue of sovereignty for the Latin Americans,\" one IADB official said.     With a 54.2 per cent voting bloc, Latin American nations have had relatively easy access to 35 billion dlrs in project loans since the bank\\'s founding in 1959.     The bank has also been run for the past 12 years by a Mexican, Antonio Ortiz Mena, who has been increasingly critical of U.S. Debt strategy in the last two years.     Ortiz Mena says commercial banks must renew lending to the region if debtors are to grow and repay creditors. At a news conference last week he warned that Latin defaults were a distinct possibility in the long run.     Brazil insists its debt service obligations should in no way interfere with growth priorities, a position putting the issue of debt relief squarely into focus for the first time, officials and delegates said.     They said creditors are not ready to discuss debt forgiveness and prefer to look at schemes such as debt-equity swaps in combination with a continuing emphasis on economic reforms.     Washington wants the IADB to impose greater conditions on lending, and has threatened to block increased appropriations for the bank if it does not get its way.     Latin America, while retaining reservations, now accepts the principle of setting greater conditions on loans, but is unwilling to countenance U.S. Demands for greater veto powers on lending, officials and delegates said.     Washington has pushed for veto power to be lowered to 35 pct from a simple majority as at present. Latin Americans are unwilling to go below 40 pct, which would oblige the U.S. To line up two other voters or voting blocs on its side.     This attempt to weaken Latin America\\'s voting power, and particularly a threat by Washington to reduce funds to the IADB unless its reforms are accepted, has created considerable resentment among Latin Americans.     \"Debtors have already shown considerable willingness to sacrifice over the last five years so economic adjustment is not at issue,\" one Latin American official said.     The region has been hoping for a seventh replenishment of IADB resources of at least 20 billion dlrs for 1987-90, as against 15.7 billion for the previous four-year period.  REUTER '},\n",

Policymakers must also face up to the reality that the bulk of world oil reserves lies in the Middle East, he said in a speech prepared for delivery to the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference.     It appears ever more likely that new discoveries elsewhere will not change this fact, he said.     McIvor said 37 of the world\\'s 30,000 oil fields contain about 35 pct of all oil ever discovered.     Only 11 of these 37 super-giant fields lie outside the Middle East and only five of the 37 have been discovered in the last 20 years, three of them in the Middle East, he said.     He also said that since 1970, the world has been consuming 20 to 25 billion barrels a year while making discoveries at the rate of only 10 to 15 billion barrels a year.     More than half of remaining proved reserves are in the Middle East, he said.     McIvor said it was important to continue to search for oil outside the Middle East because each addition contributes to a diversity of supply desirable for global political and economic stability.     \"It is important to enhance the likelihood of home-country discoveries with measures such as non-discriminatory and stable taxation, and minimum regulation, together with opening up of acreage for exploration,\" he said.

              "  'BODY': 'A 10 percentage point reduction in the Australian government\\'s maximum crude oil levy on old oil would stabilize Bass Straits oil output, resources analyst Ian Story said here.     A reduction to 70 pct from 80 pct would enable Bass Strait output to be maintained at the current rate of 420,000 barrels per day (BPD) for the next year rather than falling to 380,000 BPD in 1987/88, he told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association annual conference.     Story is an analyst with and a director of Sydney stockbroker Meares and Philips Ltd.     Windfall profits taxes on Bass Strait crude are no longer appropriate in the current economic climate, Story said.     The maximum 80 pct levy on old oil -- that discovered before September 1975 -- is now forcing the Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S>/Exxon Corp <XON> partnership to shut-in production, accelerating the decline in output and reducing government revenue, he said.     He said the producer return per barrel at a price of 30 Australian dlrs a barrel would rise to 2.07 dlrs from 0.80 dlrs if the levy was cut to 70 pct.     \"The economics at an 80 pct levy are simply not attractive at oil prices below 30 dlrs,\" Story said.     Cutting the maximum levy rate to 70 pct would create higher levels of self-sufficiency, increase government revenue, boost exports and provide incentives for exploration and development, he said.

He told an informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting the widening gap between developed and developing countries and an inequitable international economic system were major impediments to growth in developing countries.     Delegates from 23 countries are attending the GATT talks in the New Zealand resort of Taupo.     \"I wish to emphasise that the growth in the volume of the external indebtedness of African countries reflects the full effect of the deflationary monetary and trade policies of the developed market economy countries,\" Mamman said.     \"The developed market economy countries have slowed down output growth thereby drying up markets for the commodity exports of African countries.\"     Mamman said the World Bank estimated 35.3 billion dlrs a year would be needed over the next five years for the African continent to be able to achieve a gross domestic product growth (GDP) rate of three to four pct by 1990.

              "  'TITLE': 'GERMAN BOND YIELDS SEEN FALLING IN NEAR TERM ',\n",
              "  'BODY': 'West German bond yields could decline over the next few months if recent efforts to stabilize exchange rates, as seen in last month\\'s Paris pact, extend to keeping down European interest rates, banking economists said.     But in the longer term domestic yields could rise under agreements to stimulate West Germany\\'s economy, they said.     The Paris agreement has so far successfully stabilized currencies with the threat of central bank intervention, economists said.     Economists speculated that G-7 countries may try to bolster the pact by uncoupling U.S. and West German interest rates further when they meet for the IMF Interim Committee in April. \"The recent round of monetary accommodation by the Bundesbank and the Bank of Japan and the firming of the Federal Funds rate are significant. They mark an uncoupling of movements in U.S. and foreign interest rates,\" Salomon Bros Inc said in a recent study.     It said narrowing of international interest rate spreads was a major factor in the dollar\\'s fall. These spreads will have to be widened if the dollar is to be stabilized.     West German Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl encouraged the U.S. not to cut interest rates in January when the Bundesbank cut its own rates by half a point, to avoid weakening the dollar.     West German economists see room for further cuts in leading West German rates if the dollar resumes its decline.     \"It\\'s not a taboo,\" Peter Pietsch, spokesman for Commerzbank AG said.     But most economists see room for a cut in West German rates only in the first half of the year, as re-emerging inflation will limit room for manoeuvre later in the year.     The Bundesbank\\'s average yield of public paper is already nearing last year\\'s low. Last week, yields fell to around 5.50 pct, not far from the 1986 low of 5.35 pct posted in mid-April.  Economists said the trend may cause domestic investors to shift some funds from short to longer-term paper. Such a move would tend to flatten the yield curve between short and long-term rates, which has become more pronounced since the Bundesbank lowered its discount rate.     It might also facilitate a further cut in leading rates, as the shift out of savings accounts into securities would slow growth of the Bundesbank\\'s central bank money stock aggregate.     But conflicting with this trend are plans to increase West German tax cuts, part of the Paris currency pact designed to meet U.S. demands for faster West German growth. This move may force interest rates up by creating a revenue vacuum which must be filled by higher government borrowing.     This may not occur if private sector demand for credit remains weak, but demand could emerge if rates begin rising.     Economists said it appeared the government had already stepped up borrowing this year to accomodate revenue loss from other sources, including tax losses resulting from weaker than expected economic growth, and higher than expected spending.     Josef Koerner, chief economist of the West German Ifo-Institut, said in a newspaper interview he expected 1987 tax revenue to be some 11 billion marks below estimates by the West German government in November.     Any tax shortfall in itself is unlikely to push yields up. But coupled with other factors such as waning foreign speculative buying of mark bonds on the dollar\\'s decline, long term yields may to have to rise, economists said.     Public authority borrowing in 1988 may also rise owing to increases in the second phase of Bonn\\'s tax reform package.     The West German government is raising its total tax cuts in 1988 by 5.2 billion marks to 14.4 billion.     West German chancellor Helmut Kohl said last week increased borrowing to finance the tax reform is acceptable.     Finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said last Thursday he was looking for other ways to finance the reform, such as raising indirect taxes.     But few economists believe the government will be able to go through with its tax measures without increasing net borrowing.     The Bundesbank said in its February report that it was wrong to believe that the first stage of the tax reform in 1986 could be managed without increasing deficits.     The Bundesbank said West German public authorities borrowed a large 21.9 billion marks in credit markets in the 1986 final quarter compared with 14.8 billion in fourth quarter 1985.     The federal government took up nearly 10 billion marks of the fourth quarter 1986 figures, and also drew on two billion marks of Bundesbank advances at the end of the year, when it had not required such a credit in the 1985 quarter.

In a statement to the informal GATT trade ministers conference here he said agriculture is a problem which involves all countries and seriously affects the debt servicing abilities of a number of developing countries.      He said major countries should be showing leadership on this problem.     \"We will be giving close attention to the processes in the OECD (Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development) and elsewhere leading to the Venice economic summit where we will be looking to the participants to adopt a strong commitment to agricultural trade reform,\" Dawkins said.     The Venice summit is scheduled for June.     He said Australia\\'s interests in the Uruguay Round, the eighth under the GATT, are wide ranging. Dawkins said he sees the round as providing a timely opportunity to secure further meaningful trade liberalisation in all sectors and to restore confidence in the multilateral system.     Dawkins said initial meetings of the negotiating groups established in Geneva after the GATT declaration last September in Punta del Este, Uruguay, have made a reasonable start, but it is vital that trade ministers maintain the pressure on these processes.     \"We must see that the commitments made at Punta del Este on standstill and rollback are carried into practice.\"     The standstill and rollback of protection offers the global trading system a chance to hold and wind back protection during the negotiations which are expected to last up to four years, he said.

The institute assumed an average exchange rate in the year starting April 1 of 150 yen to the dollar. It predicted the Bank of Japan will not change the official discount rate in the year.

The whole refinery was closed pending enquiries but a decision when to reopen the main units will be taken in the next couple of days, he said.     But there was extensive damage to the central part of the 32,000 bpd hydrocracker, which upgrades heavy oil products to gasoline, and it will be out of operation for some months.

BP has a 437,000 bpd refinery in Rotterdam, a 181,900 bpd unit at Ingolstadt, West Germany, a 181,900 bpd plant at Lavera in France and a smaller Swedish plant.     He said the explosion and fire, in which one worker was killed, occurred when the hydrocracker was not in operation.     The refinery as a whole had been operating at about half of its capacity since the end of January while an extensive overhaul was carried out on the North Side of the complex where the hydrocracker is sited, he said.     This work was scheduled to be completed by mid-April, but this is now being assessed following the hydrocracker accident.

              "  'BODY': 'A settlement could soon be reached in the dispute between European sugar producers and the European Community over EC export licencing policies, Jean-Marc Vernes, president of French sugar producer Beghin-Say, which is leading the protest, told journalists today.     \"Our contacts with the EC authorities over the past few days indicate that we are moving towards a solution,\" he said, adding that if this happened the producers would withdraw the 854,000 tonnes of sugar they have offered into intervention.     Vernes said that the protest, involving 770,000 tonnes of sugar from French producers alone, was prompted by the EC\\'s policy since mid-1986 of offering export rebates which failed to give producers an equivalent price to that they would obtain by offering sugar into EC intervention.     At last week\\'s tender the EC Commission made an apparent concession by offering a maximum rebate only 1.3 European currency units (Ecus) per 100 kilos below the level producers say is needed, compared with the previous week\\'s rebate which was 2.5 Ecus below the necessary level.     Vernes would not say what form any compromise between the producers and the EC would take, but he reaffirmed the long-term desire of producers to export to the world market, providing they were not losing money by doing so.     Producers can withdraw their intervention offer after April 1, when the sugar will officially enter intervention stores, or at any time over the following five weeks before the official payment date.     The EC has threatened to put the sugar back on the internal market if the producers refuse to withdraw their offers.  REUTER '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'Australian wheat plantings are forecast to fall to 10.40 mln hectares in 1987/88 from 11.72 mln sown in 1986/87, Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd (AWF) said in its first preliminary crop forecast.     But there was no reason to expect Australian production in 1987/88 would be less than the 16.5 mln tonnes of last year, the private forecaster said, as crops in New South Wales and Queensland suffered from poor yields last season.     Most of the fall in plantings was expected in Western Australia while state average yields would be assisted by growers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks, it said.     The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was a poor profit outlook under cost, credit and yield pressures. But in the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided that rainfall between now and June is not less than average, AWF said.     Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut back wheat area by 20 pct, AWF said this was unlikely since they needed cash flow and there were problems with alternative crops.     \"The lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds, pulses and oats is a cause for concern if those crops are to comprise a high proportion of growers\\' income,\" AWF said.

              "  'BODY': 'The solution of the world\\'s debt crisis requires open markets but a possible resurgence of protectionism is the biggest danger, the president of the Federal Association of German Banks, Wolfgang Roeller, said.     Roeller, who is also management board spokesman of Dresdner Bank AG, said in a radio interview it is unlikely Brazil\\'s suspension last month of part of its interest payments would lead to a chain reaction in Latin America.     It is important to increase the efficiency of debtor countries to such an extent they earn sufficient currency from exports to repay foreign debt, he said.     Brazil had taken a unilateral step, Roeller said, but Brazil had a strong and broad economic base. With the help of appropriate economic programmes there should be a way to bring back financial stability to that country.     Roeller said action on the debt situation had to be taken now. It could not be expected debtor countries would be able to repay debts in the short run, even if economic conditions improved. Programmes had to be developed which would strengthen the economic position of these countries, to ensure world economic growth so they are able to sell their products at adequate prices.     Roeller said the debt crisis could only be solved in coordination with governments, international organisations such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and creditor banks.     \"This is not a topic which can be solved by creditor banks alone,\" he said. One aim had to be to raise the credit standing of debtor countries to such a degree they are able to raise funds on international credit markets again. He said a whole set of new ideas had been developed and he was convinced the international banking system would provide more funds, but the problem is not just economic but also political.

He was talking to reporters yesterday on the eve of a two-day meeting of trade ministers which will review progress made by committees set up after the Uruguay meeting last September launched a new round of GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) talks.     European Community (EC) commissioner Willy de Clercq meanwhile told reporters conflict between the world\\'s three major trading and economic powers -- the EC, the U.S. And Japan -- set a poor example for other members of GATT.

              "  'BODY': 'Yugoslavia, whose economic crisis is under close scrutiny by foreign creditors, will not follow Brazil by suspending repayments on its large foreign debt, Prime Minister Branko Mikulic was quoted as saying.     Mikulic was speaking to West German journalists in an interview published yesterday by the Tanjug news agency.     He said Yugoslavia had always paid its debts and would continue to do so, but he said creditors and international institutions should show more \"understanding\" for Yugoslavia\\'s situation.     Mikulic said Yugoslavia had \"understanding\" for what Brazil had done.     Yugoslavia has almost 100 pct annual inflation, lagging exports and low productivity. This month Makulic imposed partial freezes on wages and prices which led to widespread strikes. Tanjug said in the interview Mikulic warned the army could be called in if Yugoslavia\\'s political system was threatened. Official reports show Yugoslavia ended 1986 with hard currency debt of 19.7 billion dlrs. In 1986 it repaid a record 5.97 billion in capital and interest, reducing its overall debt by 996 mln dlrs.     Government ministers told reporters last week they regretted Yugoslavia made such an effort in 1986. They said the cost to the economy had been too great.     Earlier this month deputy prime minister Janos Milosavljevic said Yugoslavia needed new credits. Foreign Minister Raif Dizdarevic said in Caracas, \"radical changes\" in interest rates and repayment times were needed.     Western economists said Mikulic\\'s remarks, taken with those of his ministers, could be a signal some problems were seen ahead in financing the debt repayments.     Yugoslavia\\'s debt refinancing timetable is to be considered by the Paris club at the end of this month.     The International Monetary Fund, which recently reviewed the Yugoslav economy, is said by Western diplomats to be alarmed at what it sees as a deteriorating economic crisis here and the possibility of balance of payments problems later this year.     Mikulic visits West Germany next week, and debt is expected to figure high on the agenda of his talks with Chancellor Helmut Kohl.  REUTER '},\n",

The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf.     U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made anti-ship \"Silkworm\" missiles, which pose a greater threat to merchant ships than missiles used before.     The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended to attack ships were \"misleading propaganda.\"     He said Iraq\\'s President Saddam Hussein was the main cause of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use \"all its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension.\"     Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. \"We are fully prepared to do what\\'s necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway.\"     \"We aren\\'t going into any disclosures or discussions of what might happen, but we are certainly very sympathetic to and listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in keeping navigation free in that area,\" he said.

Sarney last month suspended interest payments on Brazil\\'s 68 billion dlr commercial debt, a move which has found little favour among the country\\'s business community.

An about-turn on the IMF issue would be politically very difficult for the Sarney government and there are no firm indications such a policy reversal is in the offing.

In an article in Monday\\'s edition of the Miami Herald, Baker also criticised the concept of short-term debt relief, calling it a \"dramatic, overnight solution.\"     \"While these ideas may be well-intentioned and have some political appeal, they are impractical and counterproductive in the long run,\" he said.     The article was published to coincide with a three-day meeting here of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB).     Baker is the chief architect of the U.S. Strategy on Third World debt.     Brazil, the Third World\\'s largest debtor, last month declared a moratorium on interest repayments. It has given no indication of when it may resume interest payments, prompting fears that some large U.S. Banks may be forced into substantial debt writedowns and calling into question the viability of the U.S. Strategy.     Baker, defending the strategy, said private commercial banks have rescheduled nearly 70 billion dlrs in debt since October 1985 at longer maturities and lower interest rates.     \"Together with expected progress in commercial bank discussions with Argentina and, we hope, Brazil, this should add up to substantial new lending for the major Latin debtors in 1987,\" Baker wrote.     He estimated that debt-equity conversion plans accounted for 2.5 billion dlrs last year in four of the region\\'s major debtor states. Such plans allow foreign bank creditors to sell Third World debt at a discount to investors who then become stockholders in firms in these countries. \"These swaps aren\\'t a panacea, but they do demonstrate how a creative free market can make progress in reducing the debt burden,\" he said.

              "  'BODY': 'Brazil wants to resume interest payments on its medium- and long-term foreign debt as soon as possible and is willing to discuss ways of softening the impact of the payments suspension on bank earnings, central bank governor Francisco Gros said.     Gros, speaking to reporters yesterday after his first meeting with Brazil\\'s bank advisory committee since he was appointed last month, also promised a clear statement of Brazil\\'s economic policy would be made in the next few days.     But bankers who attended the meeting with Gros said it was inconclusive.     The bankers also expressed disappointment Gros could not give assurances as to when interest payments on the 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt would restart.     \"It was all very tentative. You can\\'t expect to get very far at the first meeting,\" one banker said.     The meeting took place on the eve of the annual meeting here of the Inter-American Development Bank.     The most urgent item on yesterday\\'s agenda was the need for a legal rollover of some 16 billion dlrs in trade and interbank credit lines extended to Brazilian banks which expire at the end of March.     Brazil has already frozen the lines to ensure it has enough credit to finance its day-to-day trade and commerce, but needs to request a formal extension of the commitments to head off possible lawsuits from disgruntled creditors.     The issue is whether the 14-bank steering committee will endorse Brazil\\'s request to the 700 creditor banks worldwide or simply relay it without comment.     This delicate question was not resolved at yesterday\\'s meeting, but lawyers from both sides will try to draft suitable language for a telex by midweek, Gros and the bankers said.     Gros said he will also formally ask the banks for a 90-day rollover of some 9.6 billion dlrs of debt which originally matured in 1986 and is now due to be repaid on April 15. Bankers said the request is a legal nicety since the money is subject to the moratorium.     Once interest on Brazil\\'s debts becomes more than 90 days overdue, U.S. And Canadian banks must put the loans on non-performing basis and may book payments only as and when they are received instead of accruing the interest in advance.     Citicorp has estimated its profits for the first quarter would be cut by 50 mln dlrs if it put Brazil on a cash basis. Other U.S. Banks have also warned of earnings setbacks.     Gros said he wished the 90-day rule was more flexible and said he would be willing to sit down with the banks to see if there was a way round the problem.     He did not elaborate. But, asked whether a bridge loan might be arranged to pay the interest, he said, \"It could happen.\"     Bankers said this possibility had not been raised at the committee meeting and dismissed it as inconsistent with Brazil\\'s determination to find a long-term solution to the problem of servicing its 110 billion dlr foreign debt.     Gros himself said pushing the problem away for 90 days at a time is not very useful. Only if Brazil has access to new loans can it grow, export and pay its debts over the longer term.     \"If the flow of funds dries up, a country like Brazil can\\'t meet all its obligations,\" he said.     Gros defended Brazil\\'s recent economic record, noting inflation slowed in February, the trade surplus rose and the public sector budget was in operational surplus.     But he said there was a need to spell out government policy, especially on prices.     \"It\\'s necessary to clarify policy for internal and external reasons,\" he said, but declined to say what economic measures might be introduced.     Once policy is in place, Gros said financing talks with the banks are likely to be tough and protracted, a sentiment echoed by the country\\'s creditors.  REUTER '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'Ministers from more than 20 nations were told by New Zealand that the next international negotiations on liberalising trade would be the last this century and the cost of failure could not be measured.     Trade minister Mike Moore told his colleagues at a welcoming ceremony before two days of talks here that great progress had been made in preparing for the negotiations which must not be sidetracked.     \"We live in troubled and dangerous times for the world trading system,\" he said.     \"We have seen that the failure of the world trading system has caused great depression and conflict in the past. Our failure to maintain the momentum will be at great cost to us all,\" Moore said.    \"The cost of failure is beyond calculation. It is our last hope and best opportunity this century. We will not get another chance before the year 2000,\" he added.     The ministers are in New Zealand to review world trade since the \"Uruguay round\" talks last September. The talks are  also part of preparations for a full-scale June meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in Venice.     The Uruguay meeting is considered by most countries to have been particularly successful, with northern hemisphere countries managing to have service industries such as banking and insurance included in the next full round.     The southerners\\' goal of including agricultural and tropical products also was met.     The meeting at this North Island tourist resort is described by participants as informal and no declaration is expected.     Moore said one aim was to \"instil a sense of political urgency to avert potential economic tragedy.\"     Another was to seek ways of popularising freer trade to people who felt the pain of readjustment but could not see the benefits, as well as preventing \"bush fires of confrontation while we proceed with orderly negotiations.\"     The meeting is being attended by 25 overseas delegations including representatives of GATT and the Economic Community.     The delegates include U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.     American sources say he is ready to state that the best way to reverse protectionist sentiment in the United States is to implement four key Uruguay proposals:     -- an end to agricultural subsidies;     -- inclusion of trade in services and investments in GATT regulations;     -- tightening of restrictions on pirating of so-called intellectual property such as trademarks, patents and copyrights;     -- new rules to resolve trade disputes among GATT\\'s 92 member states.     Earlier, New Zealand sources had said French Foreign Trade Minister Michel Noir had pulled out of the informal GATT talks for domestic political reasons.     Cabinet chief Bernard Prauge will lead the French delegation.  Reuter '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'Uganda\\'s state-run Coffee Marketing Board (CMB) has been suffering a cash crisis for the past two months due to a bottleneck in export shipments and administrative delays in handling payments, trade sources said.     The CMB needs between 10 and 15 billion shillings (the equivalent of seven to 10 mln dlrs) to pay farmers and processors for coffee already delivered, but its present export revenue is insufficient to cover such expenditure, they said.     The board\\'s cash crisis has serious implications for the economy as a whole, since coffee accounts for 95 pct of Uganda\\'s total exports.     The CMB\\'s financial difficulties first started in January following delays in rail-freighting export consignments of coffee to the ports of Mombasa, Dar es Salaam and Tanga.     These delays were caused by a shortage of railway wagons in Uganda and bottlenecks on the ferries which transport Ugandan wagons across Lake Victoria to link up with the Kenyan and Tanzanian railway systems, the sources said     Marketing Minister John Sebaana-Kizito publicly acknowledged on February 19 that the CMB had run up arrears to local suppliers as a result of the shortage of transport for moving exports.     Sebaana-Kizito said at the time that the payments squeeze would be resolved in two weeks.     However, an accident to the rail ferry which plies between the Ugandan lake port of Jinja and Kisumu in Kenya put it out of action between February 21 and March 15, causing fresh delays in cargo movements.     Coffee exports are especially sensitive to the disruption of rail transport since president Yoweri Museveni has banned their haulage by road in a drive to save transport costs.     Transport difficulties meant that by early February the CMB was holding unsold coffee stocks of around 750,000 bags.     These stocks were equivalent to one quarter of Uganda\\'s expected three mln 60-kilo bag 1986/87 (October-September) crop, the sources said.     According to the sources, the board\\'s financial problems have been aggravated by long delays in processing export receipts.     The coffee board was taking about eight weeks to recycle export receipts into payments to local producers, whereas export bills handled by local banks took half that time to process, they said.     The sources said the CMB\\'s price structure had been overtaken by Uganda\\'s high inflation rate, unofficially estimated at about 200 pct, and that this was a further disincentive to producers, already owed large arrears.     \"The coffee pricing structure is wrong and three months behind, the foreign exchange rate is unrealistic, and the sooner the so-called economic package is put in top gear, the better for the coffee industry and the economy as a whole,\" one of the sources said.     The government is currently negotiating a package of economic reforms with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund aimed at underpinning a renewed inflow of foreign aid to help Uganda\\'s economic recovery after 15 years of political strife.

              "  'BODY': 'Brazil\\'s attempt to seek better terms for paying off its 109 billion dlr foreign debt is responsible and modest, a former chairman of President Reagan\\'s Council of Economic Advisers said.     \"I think that what Brazil is calling for -- limiting its debt payments to two and one half pct of GNP -- is a responsible request on their part,\" economist Martin Feldstein said at a weekend news conference.     \"It requires additional money on the part of the banks, but rather modest additional amounts.\"     Feldstein is attending the annual meeting of the Trilateral Commission, a foreign policy group of more than 300 business and government leaders from North America, Europe and Japan.     Feldstein, one of four members of a task force on Third World debt, said that Brazil\\'s request would mean an additional credit of three billion to four billion dlrs from banks and international agencies.     \"Brazil\\'s debt would increase in dollar terms but remain constant in real terms. The four billion dlr increase in Brazil\\'s 100 billion dlr debt would represent no increase in the real inflation-adjusted size of its liability,\" he said.     Feldstein said he believed current Third World debt problems were less serious than those faced by the international monetary system in 1983 and 1985.     However, the European representative on the task force, Herve de Carmoy, chief executive international for Midland Bank PLC, disagreed.     He called the present situation more difficult and, in a draft proposal included in the task force\\'s report, suggested setting up an institution, possibly within the World Bank, with a fund that could deal with a future debt crisis.     Commission discussions were closed to reporters but it was apparent from the news conference that task force members did not agree on all points in their report.     One point of agreement, Feldstein said, was that debtor countries would need additional credit in the coming years if they are to enjoy satisfactory growth.     Feldstein said the task force, which also included Koei Narusawa, economic adviser to the president of the Bank of Toyko, and Paul Krugman, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, did not agree on how much credit would be needed.     He said they also did not reach a consensus on how willing international banks, particularly those in Japan and Europe, would be to lend the money.     The Trilateral Commission was set up in 1973 by David Rockefeller, former head of Chase Manhattan bank, and others to promote closer cooperation among the three regions.  Reuter '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'The United States and major Latin American nations agreed to set aside sharp differences over control of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) and reconsider the issue this summer.     The bank\\'s policy-making board of governors, meeting here ahead of this week\\'s IADB annual meetings, put off any decisions when it became apparent differences between Washington and the Latin countries ware too great.     IADB officials said Washington had indicated, however, it might be prepared to compromise in the future.     The United States is the principal donor nation and has pressed the bank, controlled by the Latin American borrowing nations, to cede virtual veto power over loans to Washington.     The Reagan administration wants to make the bank part of its controversial strategy to resolve the debt crisis.     The U.S. Plan calls for loans from multilateral banks like the IADB to be tied to economic reforms in debtor nations which would promote open markets, reduced government intervention and inflation-free economic growth.     Brazil, which declared an interest payments moratorium last month, is leading a challenge to Washington\\'s strategy and officials here obviously feared any decisions that might deepen rifts between the United States and Third World nations.     IADB officials also said Washington hinted at future compromise. \"The U.S. Said it remains hopeful they can reach an agreement and expressed optimism that such a consensus could be reached,\" said an official who asked not to be named.     Washington has threatened to scuttle a 20-25 billion dlr, four-year capital replenishment for the bank if the veto issue is not resolved.     But it has asked Congress to give it authority to finance its one-third share in the event agreement on voting power is reached. The United States controls 34.5 pct of the vote and wants a loan veto to exist at the 35 pct level.     Currently, a simple majority can approve or disapprove loans giving the borrowing nations control of the purse strings and resulting in loan conditions too lax for Washington\\'s taste.     The U.S. Strategy for dealing with the debt crisis is expected to be repeated by Treasury Secretary James Baker in a speech to the bank\\'s annual meeting today (Monday).     But monetary sources expect Baker to suggest the United States has some room for compromise and also to fend off other challenges to its strategy by signalling Washington is open to innovative solutions to the debt problem.

              "  'BODY': 'Treasury Secretary James Baker, facing the toughest challenge to his Third World debt plan so far, is expected today to stoutly defend the strategy.      At an opening address to the annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank here Baker is likely once again to bluntly reject alternative approaches like wholesale debt relief.      The speech comes after Washington delayed its bid to wrest control of IADB lending from Latin nations.      The Treasury Secretary is also expected, U.S. officials say, to portray that attempt as a crucial element in his plan to promote inflation-free economic growth, open markets, and a much-reduced government role in the economies of Latin America.      \"We have already seen substantial progress,\" Baker said in a Miami Herald article and argued the plan was never meant to be a \"quick fix\".      But Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Nicaragua and Bolivia have all ceased servicing some or all of their debt. Brazil\\'s interest payments moratorium, announced last month, is being seen as a major challenge to the Baker plan.      Owing foreigners 109 billion dlrs, Brazil called an indefinite interest payments moratorium on 68 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt.      Brazilian Central Banker Francisco Gros met bankers last night to begin what U.S. officials predict will be months of extremely tough negotiations.      The scale of the problem is immense. Owing some 382 billion dlrs of foreign debt, Latin nations have since the start of the decade paid out some  200 billion dlrs in interest and principal and received about 28 billion dlrs in new loans.      In addition, upwards of 100 billion dlrs in capital flight is estimated to have left the region during that time.      The Baker plan, unveiled in October, 1985, calls on commercial and multilateral banks to increase lending by about 29 billion dlrs in the three subsequent years to the 15 major debtors engaging in fundamental economic reform.      The theory runs that once a debtor nation has reformed its economy, it can service its debt comfortably and without an atmosphere of crisis.      U.S. officials emphasize some 8.5 billion dlrs has been paid out in the first 14 months of the plan, payments of over 70 billion dlrs of debt has been stretched out into the future  and Washington  is embracing new and innovative ideas to keep debtor-creditor negotiations afloat.      Baker is expected to underscore these points in his address today.  Reuter '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'The world\\'s dependency on the Mideast as the source for its petroleum is growing and nothing is going to stop it, Donald K. McIvor, an Exxon Corp <XON> Director and senior vice president told Reuters in an interview.     \"Non-OPEC production will begin to decline and the gap between demand and supply will widen so that the trend to increasing dependence on OPEC and the Middle East is inevitable,\" McIvor said.     Decreased supplies will firm prices for crude oil but are not likely to change a growing dependence, McIvor said.     McIvor, Exxon\\'s senior vice president responsible for oil and gas exploration and production said that dependence would result from the Mideast\\'s large spare capacity at a time when the rest of the world consumes more oil than it was finding.     \"Since 1970 we\\'ve been consuming oil at rates of 20-25 billion barrels per year while making new discoveries of only about 10-15 bilion barrels per year,\" McIvor said.     \"The bulk of the inventory and more than half of the remaining proved reserves lies in the middle east which is producing at much less than current capacity,\" he added.     McIvor said that of the some 30,000 oil fields discovered so far only 37 \"one-one thousandth of the total number contained about 35 pct of all the oil ever discovered.\"     McIvor said, in response to a question, that he did not believe there were any more \"super giants\", or oil fields with reserves greater than five billion barrels, to be found which would change the conclusion of the world\\'s growing dependency.     \"Of those 37 super giants only 11 lie outside the Middle East. Only five of the 37 have been discovered in the past 20 years and only two of these lie outside the middle east (Cantarell in Mexico and Alaska\\'s North Slope).\" McIvor said.     McIvor said that many of the large fields outside the U.S. like Alaska\\'s Prudhoe Bay and the North Sea were reaching a peak and would soon begin to decline.     But the Exxon executive said that there were still plenty of opportunities to be explored and developed outside of the Middle east, particulartly in Canada, the North Sea, and Australia and Africa.     McIvor said that decisions to explore and drill in those areas would be depedent upon both the expectations of a higher price of oil as well as the legal regime affecting the companies.     \"The ideal regime is a stable one not one where there is a constant change in policies,\" McIvor said.     McIvor said he opposed import subsidies or tariffs used to increase exploration as these only benefit one part of the economy at the expense of other parts of the economy.     Asked about the options offered this week by U.S. Energy Secretary Herrington to increase U.S. production McIvor said he could not comment on subjects like the oil depletion allowance now but \"the thrust of his (Herrington) report is valid. It has highlighted the growing dependency on the Middle east and the need to increase U.S. production.\"     McIvor also said that he expected natural gas to play a greater role in the future in meeting energy needs.     \"Natural gas will have the opportunity to become an increasingly important part of the worlkd\\'s energy supply,\" McIvor said.     \"Crude oil will be used more and more as a transportation fuel and natural gas will be used more to generate heat, as an industrial fuel,\" he added.

              "  'BODY': \"Representatives from Nigeria are meeting today and tomorrow with officials of Britain's Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) in the first of what could be a series of bilateral talks to reschedule Nigeria's official debts, banking sources said.     The talks follow an agreement reached between Nigeria and the Paris Club of western creditor governments in December to reschedule some 7.5 billion dlrs of medium and long-term debt due between September, 1986 and end 1987 over 10 years with five years grace. Nigeria's official debts to the U.K., Its major trading partner, are estimated at 2.5 to three billion dlrs.     If the talks prove successful, the Nigerian team, headed by Finance Minister Che Okongwu and Central Bank Governor Abdulkadir Ahmed, will hold similar talks with French export credit officials in Paris later this week, the sources said.     An agreement could pave the way for ECGD to resume insurance cover for exports to Nigeria, which was suspended in 1983.     The rescheduling of Nigeria's official debts was one of the demands required under a rescheduling of part of the country's estimated 19 billion dlrs of commercial bank debt, for which agreement also was reached in December between Nigeria and a steering committee representing the commercial banks.     The commercial bank rescheduling has yet to be finalised because of the reluctance of Japanese banks to participate in the agreement, despite a recent trip to Japan by senior Nigerian officials and representatives of the steering committee.     The entire package also is being held up because of the need to reach an agreement to satisfy arrears due on short-term insured and uninsured debts. However, bankers are hopeful that an accord will be struck by May 31.     The Nigerians also are attempting to reconcile creditors' claims with their own receipts on some two billion dlrs of letters of credit contained in the commercial bank rescheduling.     Bankers said that it was hoped that the ECGD would resume cover fairly soon as this could encourage other official creditors to begin bi-lateral talks as well.     Under the structural adjustment program supporting the debt reschedulings Nigeria is due to receive 900 mln dlrs in fresh export credits this year from official export credit agencies.     British exports to Nigeria were 565 mln stg in 1986, down from 960 mln in 1985, while Nigeria's exports to Britain, which do not include oil, were 328 mln stg and 647 mln, respectively.

              "  'BODY': 'Japan has launched a last-ditch effort to salvage its computer micro-chip pact with the United States - sending a letter to top American policy makers setting out its case and instructing its producers to cut output further.     \"We must make our utmost effort to ward off any catastrophe,\" Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) Deputy Director General Masaji Yamamoto told reporters.     \"If hasty action is taken in the United States, it will create very serious problems.\"     The Reagan Administration\\'s Economic Policy is expected to meet Thursday to review Japanese compliance with the bilateral agreement hammered out last year. Under the pact, Tokyo agreed to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to increase its imports of American semiconductors.     Washington has accused Japan of reneging on the deal by selling low priced chips in Asia and by failing to boost American imports, and has threatened to take retaliatory action.     In an effort to save the agreement, MITI is asking Japanese chip makers to limit production in the hope that will boost domestic demand and reduce the incentive to export.     Yamamoto said that Japan will slash output of 256 kilobit dynamic random access and erasable programmable read only memory chips by 11 pct in the second quarter. This follows a cutback of more than 20 pct in the first three months of the year.     He said the cutbacks were already drying up the supply of chips available for export through unregulated distributors in the so-called grey market.     \"We have almost no grey market,\" he said. \"Supply is diminishing.\"     To help ensure that the cutbacks are implemented, MITI called in the president of Japan\\'s largest semiconductor maker, NEC Corp <NIPN.T> last week, he said. It is also issuing specific instructions on production to the Japanese subsidiary of <Texas Instruments Inc>.     Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura spelled out the steps Japan was taking to salvage the pact and appealed for U.S. Understanding in a letter to top American policy makers.     The letter was sent today to U.S. Secretary of State George Schultz, Treasury Secretary James Baker, Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.     The four, who make up the Economic Policy Council, are expected to consider evidence presented by U.S. Chip maker Micron Technology Inc <DRAM.O> of cut-price Japanese sales in Hong Kong.     Yamamoto admitted that <Oki Electric Industry Co>\\'s Hong Kong subsidiary had sold chips at an inappropriate level but denied that it was dumping chips at rock-bottom prices.     \"If the United States uses this as proof of dumping...We will present our rebuttal,\" he said.     The sales though were inappropriate in the light of MITI\\'s advice to semiconductor makers to sell chips at well above production costs to avoid any hint of dumping, he said.     He also called the case \"strange,\" but he stopped short of endorsing Japanese newspaper accusations that Oki had been trapped into making the sales. He did say though that Micron publicized the invoice documenting the sales on the same day they were made and that Oki was unable to locate the person who had bought the chips when it tried to buy them back last week.

              "  'BODY': 'The Inter-American Development Bank said it intended this year to match the over three billion dlrs it lent to Latin America in 1986, despite growing pressures on its capital.     In its annual report and in a briefing for reporters, the Bank made it clear, however, that the Latin countries needed vast amounts of new investment if they are to strengthen their ailing economies in the period ahead. The report said Latin America continued to emerge slowly from the deep recession that began in the early 1980s, with Gross Domestic Product edging up to nearly four pct from 3.5 pct in 1985.     The report said the region\\'s improved economic growth last year was based on a rise in internal demand and fuller utilization previously underused production capacity.     \"This situation will be difficult to duplicate in 1987 and beyond because no significant new investments are being made,\" the report said.     The Bank\\'s lending last year consisted of 63 loans totaling 3.04 billion dlrs, bringing the agency\\'s cumulative lending to 35.44 billion dlrs.     Of last year\\'s loans, 2.26 billion dlrs was actually disbursed, bringing total disbursements to 24.03 billion dlrs.     To assist in loan activities, the Bank said it borrowed 1.91 billion dlrs in the capital markets in 1986, bringing its total outstanding borrowings to 12.11 billion dlrs.     In a briefing for reporters, Bank President Antonio Ortiz-Mena said that this year lending by the bank \"will be at a similar level to last year.\"     He noted that bank lending in 1986 was directed particularly to projects in energy, agriculture, and environmental and public health, education and urban development. The annual report was released as the Bank\\'s annual meeting is being held in Miami.     Ortiz-Mena told reporters that the bank\\'s member countries will discuss a plan by the United States to reduce the loan veto power from the current majority to 35 pct.     Such a plan would allow the United States to block any loan it did not like with the assistance of only one other country.     The proposal, which is tied to any U.S. backing for a new financing for the bank, is sure to run into rough going as the Latin countries view it as a move by the Reagan administration to control the agency\\'s critical loans.     The U.S. position is that it is not seeking veto power although it believes the bank\\'s largest contributors should have greater influence within the institution.      Reuter '},\n",

              "  'TITLE': 'U.S. CORPORATE FINANCE - NOVEL GMAC FINANCING',\n",
              "  'BODY': 'Because its novel financing deal sold quickly last week, General Motors Corp\\'s <GM> General Motors Acceptance Corp unit plans to do more multi-tiered financings, said Michael Mangan of GMAC.     \"We are certainly happy with the transaction. We plan to do more,\" said Mangan, director of corporate financing.     Offered on Wednesday, the 100 mln dlr issue had three price levels to attract a wide range of retail investors and small regional institutions, said officers of P.W. Korth and Co Inc and PaineWebber Inc, which shared bookrunning duties.     \"We will continue to look at multi-tiered financings,\" Mangan said.     \"GMAC plans to talk to Korth and PaineWebber and get their thoughts on the deal. We want to see how it went and where the securities were placed,\" the GMAC officer added.     Mangan and the co-lead managers said the three different pricings enabled the finance arm of General Motors to borrow at attractive rates. \"GMAC saved some basis points with this technique,\" said an officer on Korth\\'s syndicate desk.     \"Our all-in-cost was comparable. If the deal had not made sense, obviously we would not have done it,\" Mangan noted.     The GMAC seven-year notes were given a coupon of 7.45 pct.     For investors buying less than 100,000 dlrs of the notes, the offering was priced at par to yield 45 basis points over comparable Treasury securities.     Those buying 100,000 to 250,000 dlrs pay 99.60 for a yield of 7.52 pct, or 53 basis points over Treasuries. For purchases of more than 250,000 dlrs, the notes carried a price of 99.20 to yield 7.599 pct, or 61 basis points over Treasuries.     In contrast, Ford Motor Co\\'s <F> Ford Motor Credit Co unit last month sold 300 mln dlrs of same-maturity notes priced to yield 7.62 pct, or 62.5 basis points over Treasuries.     \"Retail investors generally do not see new issue product,\" said an officer on PaineWebber\\'s corporate syndicate desk. \"They have to buy the securities in the secondary market.\"     Bond traders said many corporates rose well above par in the secondary market this year. They attributed this to a huge number of bond redemptions by the issuing companies.     \"Institutions and mutual funds are seeing some of their holdings called away. They\\'re scrambling to replace them,\" said one trader. As a result, underwriters said retail investors would gladly sacrifice some of the yield spread over Treasuries if they could buy debt issues at or below par.     \"The GMAC financing seemed tailor-made for those retail investors,\" commented one underwriter away from the syndicate.     GMAC\\'s Mangan said his firm also wanted to sell securities that were aimed at the retail sector.     \"Access to retail investors was the driving force behind the multi-tiered financing. This is a new market for us, so to speak,\" Mangan said.     \"There is a lot of GMAC paper out there,\" the executive added, referring to the unit\\'s past offerings. \"One of our basic strategies is to target securities to specific investors and hopefully attain a broader distribution.\"     Officers of Korth and PaineWebber said the GMAC notes were selling quickly last week, although the issue had not sold out by Friday afternoon.     \"In selling to retail investors or smaller institutions, you have to make a lot more telephone calls,\" an investment banker pointed out.     Underwriters noted that Korth and PaineWebber, along with co-managers A.G. Edwards and Thomson McKinnon, have strong retail bases. \"They can carve out a niche here,\" one said.     \"We plan to underwrite more of these deals,\" said a Korth official. An officer with PaineWebber echoed that sentiment.     Multi-tiered financings are a relatively new wrinkle on Wall Street. An officer with Korth said he belives his firm underwrote the first such issue eight or nine months ago for Citicorp <CCI>.     GMAC\\'s Mangan said his company issued through Korth in October 1986 a 50 mln dlr issue that carried two different price levels.     \"But the price gap between the first and second tier was large,\" Mangan said. In our conversations with the underwriters, we thought three different tiers would make more sense because the prices would not be far apart.\"     Meanwhile, underwriting syndicates are scheduled to bid competitively tomorrow for 250 mln dlrs of first and refunding mortgage bonds due 2017 of Philadelphia Electric Co <PE>. Non-refundable for five years, the debt is rated Baa-3 by Moody\\'s and BBB-minus by Standard and Poor\\'s.     Southern Railway Co, a unit of Norfolk Southern Corp <NSC>, will hold accept bids on Wednesday for 20 mln dlrs of serial equipment trust certificates. The debt is rated a top-flight AAA by both Moody\\'s and S and P.     IDD Information Services said the 30-day corporate visible supply rose to 3.98 billion dlrs from 3.28 billion dlrs.

              "  'BODY': 'U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said he was making progress negotiating reform of the Inter-American Development Bank with other member nations.     In a speech prepared for delivery to the annual meeting of the IADB, Baker said, \"We are making progress in negotiating reforms.\"     And he added that if succesful, Washington would be ready to put up an additional nine billion dlrs to the seventh IADB four-year capital replenishment, an increase of 75 pct.     It was not immediately clear what the overall size of the capital replenishment would be if the U.S. went ahead with such a capital increase.     But Baker\\'s statement that he had made progress in negotiating reforms came after a weekend meeting of the bank\\'s policy making board of governors at which the reform issue was put off until next June because of deep differences between Washington and Latin borrowing countries.     Baker said the U.S. increase would account for 70 pct of the bank\\'s useable financial resources.     Currently Washington is only allowed to vote 34.5 pct in IADB board meetings considering loans to Latin American countries.     But the Latin borrowing nations control 54 pct of the vote and frequently approve loans to which economic reform conditions are not tied.     Baker pointed out that Western nations which provide 95 pct of the bank\\'s financial resources represent just 46 pct of the vote.     Baker said the U.S seeks a greater say in bank decisions for itself and other creditor countries.     \"In view of this imbalance we don\\'t believe it is unreasonable to ask for a change,\" Baker said. He said the changes sought by the U.S. would require loan approval by a greater majority of shares than a simple majority.     But he stopped short of reaffirming the original U.S. position that veto power should exist with a 35 pct vote.     Enlarging on reforms Washington would like to see, Baker said he wanted the IADB to play a much greater role in the U.S. debt strategy for promoting inflation free economic growth, open markets and a reduced government role in the economies of debtor nations.     Under reforms he said the U.S. wants the IADB to adopt a major program of lending to specific economic sectors in debtor countries on condition the countries carried out policy reforms in those areas of their economies.     Such reforms would include, among other things, more concern for natural resource management.     Baker said this lending should help debtors make a transition to more open economies and freer markets.     He also said the bank could double its current lending volume from capital and triple its concessional loans to the poorest nations.     The Treasury Secretary also called for the IADB to improve its analysis of the policies of debtor countries, strengthening its process for assessing the specific needs of debtor nations. He urged a wholesale reorganization of bank personnel. Baker said, \"We simply believe that more discretion and policy influence should lie with the parties which contribute the lion\\'s share of resources.\"     He pointed out that despite tight budget problems the Reagan administration has asked Congress to finance the IADB and other multilateral development banks.     Pointing out that such funding was difficult today in the best of circumstances, he said it would be impossible if Congress did not have confidence in bank lending policies.  Reuter '},\n",

The toy manufacturer attributed its anticipated lower financial results to an an expected moderate decline in shipments of its Pound Puppies product line.     Tonka also said it expects revenues and earnings to remain lower through the 1987 first half compared with 1986 record results of 125.4 mln dlrs in revenues and 10.3 mln dlrs in net earnings or 1.47 dlrs a share.

Tonka\\'s first quarter shipments will be down somewhat from 1986 record levels and gross profit margins will be down slightly from a year ago, it said.

He told the annual news conference that possible credit risks, especially those associated with foreign nations, had largely been covered. Risk provisions in 1987 were therefore unlikely to reach the same high level as in 1986.     Group bank net profit rose to 275.52 mln marks in 1986 from 222.73 mln the previous year and parent bank net profit increased to 187.63 mln marks from 161.58 mln.     Hackl said that interest margins in the banking business had declined to 2.71 pct last year from 2.78 pct the previous year. But in the mortgage sector, the margins had increased slightly and stood around 0.7 pct.     Parent bank commission surplus in the securities business had risen almost 15 pct to 358 mln marks in 1986.     Expenses for personnel had increased 7.5 pct to 782 mln marks and others costs had increased 9.4 pct to 272 mln marks.     The parent bank's 1986 partial operating profit, which excludes earnings from trading on its own account, had climbed two pct to 671 mln marks.     The parent bank's balance sheet total rose 5.3 pct to 81.5 billion marks at end-1986 compared with end-1985, Hackl said.     It was boosted by a three billion mark rise in mortgage business and a 1.1 billion mark increase in banking business.     The mortgage sector's share in total parent bank business volume rose to 46 pct from 45.     Hackl said that in January and February this year, the bank's credit business had not livened up. But despite the sharp downturn on German bourses, profits from trading on own account had increased in the first two 1987 months compared with the same year-ago period. He gave no detailed figures.

              "  'BODY': 'Treasury Secretary James Baker urged commercial banks to be open to new ideas for reducing the third world debt burden.     \"I believe the commercial banks need to be open to creative ideas for reducing the debt burden,\" Baker told the annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank.     But he said that he was confident banks would make \"substantial new lending\" to the major debtors this year.     He pointed out principal debtor nations are expected to grow an average 3.5 pct this year, the fastest real rate of growth since 1980.     Saying the U.S. debt strategy was making \"substantial headway\", Baker said import volumes of debtor countries are forecast to jump over six pct in 1987 and export volumes almost five pct -- the best performance in three years.     He also said economic growth has kept pace with or surpassed the growth in debt for nine of the 15 major debtors since 1983.     \"This is a start -- and I venture to say a good one,\" the Treasury Secretary said, and he urged the audience of Western and Latin finance officials and bankers to stand fast against suggestions of solutions like debt relief.     While such ideas have political appeal, Baker said, they would mean a drying up of capital flowing to debtors.     And even if free market reforms followed, debt fogiveness would frighten away investors who would not \"risk their capital in a country which abandoned its obligations.\"     And he said, \"A debt forgiveness plan that damages commercial banks also weakens confidence in world financial stability.\"     He cautioned that resolving the debt situation would be a \"gradual and painstaking\" process, varying from country to country.     Reporting on the U.S. debt strategy, Baker said attitudes in debtor nations have changed and there is much greater acceptance of free market reforms than hitherto.     Some countries like Argentina are pursuing anti-inflation programs. Others, like the Philippines and Chile, are privatizing companies and swapping debt for equity.     The International Monetary Fund and World Bank, meanwhile, have committed nearly 12 billion dlrs in loans for the 15 major debtor nations since late 1985, official creditors have rescheduled 14.5 billion dlrs in outstanding loans through the Paris club, while commercial banks are making new loans.     Baker pointed out the banks have rescheduld nearly 70 billion dlrs of debt, reaching agreements recently with Chile, Venezuela and Mexico.     Elsewhere in his speech, Baker outlined the progress industrial nations are making in promoting moderate global growth, low inflation and efforts to reduce massive trade imbalances.     He maintained world economic conditions were \"continuuing to improve\" a development that would provide a positive backdrop for debtor nations.  Reuter '},\n",

Addressing Argentine businessman during the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) meeting here, he said the two sides will meet again next Thursday in New York.     \"We have made significant progress over the last 30 days and we should have an agreement in a shorter lapse of time than managed by Mexico, Venezuela or Chile,\" he said.     Brodersohn reiterated that Argentina\\'s goal is to reach an agreement which permits four pct growth this year, following last year\\'s 5.5 pct and negative growth in 1985.     He said discussions were still continuing on debt-capitalization plans and schemes for on-lending, in the light of certain Argentine concerns.     The government is anxious that debt that is capitalized should represent new investment in the country on a dollar invested per dollar capitalized basis, rather than a simple transfer of ownership of the debt, he said.     At the same time, it wants to avoid an expansionary monetary impact from on-lending schemes, whereby debt repayments are recycled by banks into new loans.     Brodersohn said also agreement was close on the proposal for so-called exit bonds, whereby creditors can sell out their debt.     Argentina\\'s 1987 financing needs come to 3.53 billion dlrs, including the 2.15 billion from banks and a 1.38 billion dlr IMF loan already agreed. It is projecting a current account deficit of 2.2 billion dlrs after one of 2.4 billion last year.     It estimates export earnings will have dropped by 7.1 billion dlrs between 1985-87 as a result of falling commodity prices.

The Alligator Ridge Mine is jointly owned by Amselco and Nerco, a unit of Nerco Inc <NER>, which is 90.5 pct owned by Pacificorp <PPW>, a Portland, Ore., holding company.     The mine has produced about 60,000 ounces of gold a year since 1981 using another leaching process, a BP spokesman said. The open pit oxide ore reserves of Alligator Ridge will be exhausted by August 1987, as expected, when the work force will be reduced to about 72 from 127, the company said.     The employees remaining after that will operate the new plant, it said.  Reuter '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'Deputy Prime Minister Janez Zemljaric, speaking before a meeting with the Paris Club of creditor nations, said Yugoslavia was seeking to refinance two billion dlrs of debt.     The official Tanjug news agency quoted Zemljaric as saying Yugoslavia expected a \"definite measure of understanding\" from 16 western creditor countries when they meet on March 30.     Zemljaric was not quoted as saying whether the two billion dlrs referred to principal or interest or both. Yugoslavia\\'s hard currency debt stands between 19 and 20 billion dlrs.     Zemljaric said the International Monetary Fund criticised Yugoslavia for not regulating consumption, not having real interest rates or market exchange rates, for its inability to control monetary policy and slow pace of reform.     He said the criticisms were in a report by an IMF commission which visited Yugoslavia last December and January.     \"We cannot accept this assessment because we have made not inconsiderable progress under difficult conditions, even though we are aware of our own weaknesses,\" Zemljaric said.     He said the report favourably assessed some trends in the Yugoslav economy but did not say which.     Milos Milosavljevic, also a Deputy Prime Minister, said last Friday that Yugoslavia had repaid 640 mln dlrs of principal and 325 mln dlrs of interest so far in 1987.     According to official Yugoslav figures, Yugoslavia repaid a record 5.97 billion dlrs in capital and interest in 1986.     In an interview with the West German weekly magazine Der Spiegel, Prime Minister Branko Mikulic said last weekend Yugoslavia had repaid 28.3 billion dlrs in principal and interest between 1981 and 1986.

              "  'BODY': 'Portugal\\'s Agriculture Minister Alvaro Barreto said he disagreed with a court order barring the state grain buying agency EPAC from taking part in cereals import tenders open to private traders.     Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmitted to the tenders.     Under the terms of Portugal\\'s January 1986 accession to the European Community (EC), a grain import monopoly held by EPAC (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.     Following legal proceedings by private importers, Lisbon\\'s civil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month that EPAC should not be allowed to take part, as it had done, in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports.     As a result of this ruling, EPAC was excluded from a March 12 tender for the import of 80,000 tonnes of maize.     Barreto said, \"My objective is put EPAC into the tenders because it has a right to take part.\" He added the government would be studying the court order to see whether or not the ruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders.     Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator, whether public or private, from the tenders. Private traders had argued that EPAC, given its dominant position in the Portuguese grain market, had an unfair advantage over them.     \"There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system,\" Barreto said. He said the EC\\'s executive commission had accepted the government\\'s view that EPAC should be eligible.     The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPAC\\'s participation in the public tenders was unfair competition and violated the clauses of Portugal\\'s EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual dismantling of the state agency\\'s import monopoly.

The Senate could consider a House-passed bill that would allow wheat and feedgrains farmers to receive at least 92 pct of their income support payments if flooding last year prevented, or will prevent, them from planting their 1987 crops, Senate staff members told Reuters.     Also pending is a bill extend the life of the National Commission on Dairy Policy.     Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., intends to offer an amendment to one of the bills that would suspend the minimum planting requirement for all 1987 wheat, feedgrain, cotton and rice producers, an aide said.     Under current law, producers must plant at least 50 pct of their base acreage to be eligible for 92 pct of their deficiency payments.     Most major U.S. farm groups have lobbied hard against making any fundamental changes in the 1985 farm bill out of fear a full-scale debate could expose agricultural problems to budget-cutting pressures.

              "  'BODY': 'Amalgamated Metal Trading, AMT, today lodged an appeal against the ruling which prevented its petition to wind up the International Tin Council, ITC.     The verdict was given by Mr Justice Millett on January 22, when AMT led an effort by ITC creditors to recover sums claimed by banks and London Metal Exchange brokers as a result of the collapse of the ITC\\'s buffer stock operations in October 1985. AMT had until March 26 to lodge its appeal.     The grounds for the appeal are that the judge erred on three points when giving his verdict, Michael Arnold, head of the broker creditors group Tinco Realisations, told Reuters.     The judge ruled that the U.K. Court had no jurisdiction to wind up the Tin Council, that the ITC was not an association within the meaning of the Companies Act, and that the winding-up petition was not a proceeding in respect of an arbitration award. AMT will contest all three points.     The U.K. Companies Act allows the possibility of the winding-up of what it defines as an association, and AMT will argue that the Tin Council falls within this definition, Arnold said.     The ITC has immunity except for the enforcement of an arbitration award, and thus it is important for AMT that the court accepts that the winding-up petition represents a move to enforce an arbitration ruling.     The court originally decided that the winding-up petition went wider than the enforcement of such a debt, an AMT spokesman said.     The appeal is unlikely to be heard for several months, but a case brought by fellow ITC creditor Maclaine Watson is to be heard on April 28. This is a move by the metal broker to have a receiver appointed over the ITC\\'s assets.     Since similar arguments will be used in this case, it is possible that any appeal in the Maclaine Watson case could be consolidated with AMT\\'s appeal, Arnold said.     Other ITC creditors have brought direct actions against the Council\\'s member states and an application by the governments to strike out the first of these, brought by J.H. Rayner (Mincing Lane) Ltd, is to be heard on May 11.     Shearson Lehman Brothers action against the LME\\'s tin \"ring-out\" in March 1986 is also scheduled to be heard in the near future.

              "  'BODY': 'The United States has offered Navy warships to escort Kuwaiti oil tankers into and out of the  Gulf where they could be threatened by new Iranian anti-ship missiles, U.S. defense officials said today.     \"We believe the Kuwaitis have also approached the Soviet Union about the possibility of using Soviet tankers\" to ship their oil, one of the officials told Reuters. \"But if there is superpower protection, we would rather it come from us,\" the official said.     The officials, who asked not to be identified, said Kuwait had asked about possible protection for a dozen vessels, most of them oil tankers, which could be supplied by three U.S. Navy guided missile destroyers and two guided missile frigates now in the southern part of the Gulf.     \"We told them we would give them help and we are waiting to hear the Kuwaiti response to our offer,\" one official said.     In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy\\'s small Mideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz, the Pentagon has moved 18 warships -- including the Aircraft Carrier Kitty Hawk -- into the northern Indian Ocean in the past month.     White House and defense officials said today that massing of the fleet was routine and had nothing to do with the Iran-Iraq war or Iran\\'s recent stationing of Chinese-made  anti-ship missiles near the mouth of the Gulf.     The land-based missiles have increased concern in Kuwait and other Middle East countries that their oil shipments might be affected. Several hundred vessels have been confirmed hit in the  Gulf by Iran and Iraq since early 1984. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters today that it was in the U.S. strategic interest to keep the free flow of oil in the gulf and through the Straits of Hormuz.     But he said U.S. ships in the region were on routine maneuvers.     Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger on Sunday declined to discuss specifics, but said the United States would do whatever was necessary to keep the Gulf shipping open in the face of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the region.     \"We are fully prepared to do what\\'s necessary to keep the shipping going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very vital waterway of the world,\" he said on NBC television\\'s \"Meet the Press.\"     The State Department said Friday Iran has been informed about U.S. concern over the threat to oil shipments in the Gulf. The communciation was sent through Switzerland, which represents American interests in Iran.      Iran on Sunday denied as baseless reports that it intended to threaten shipping in the gulf and warned the United States that any interference in the region would meet a strong response from Tehran, Tehran Radio said.     An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman, quoted in a broadcast monitored by the BBC in London, said reports that Iran intends to threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless.     \"In conjunction with this misleading propaganda, America has already paved the ground to achieve its expansionist and hegemonistic intentions, aiming to build up its military presence in the region,\" he was quoted as saying.

Lechin, 83, became one of 12 COB leaders to join a hunger strike to protest against the austerity programme of the government of president Victor Paz Estenssoro.     The striking leader began his fast as leaders of 9,000 miners employed by the state corporation COMIBOL were due to star negotiations on ways to solve their conflict over pay.     About 1,300 miners and workers entered today their fourth day of fast in union offices and Roman Catholic churches to press for a substantial hike in Bolivia\\'s minimum monthly wage, which is 40 bolivianos (about 20 dlrs), COB leader Walter Degadillo said.     \"I will take part in the miners\\' negotiations because that does not force me to suspend my fast,\" Lechin told reporters.

Terms were not disclosed.     Wolverine said the action continues the restructuring operation begun last July to make the company more competitive and profitable. Wolverine said it will concentrate its effort in the athletic footwear market in its Brooks footwear division.     Wolverine said it expects \"favorable results in the second half as a result\" of its restructuring. In 1986 it said restructuring helped improve its financial capabilities.     The company reported a 12.6 mln dlr loss, or 1.75 dlrs a share, in 1986 due largely to a 9.0 mln dlr restructuring charge and a 4.0 mln dlr inventory evaluation readjustment taken in the second quarter.     Since that time, it has sold two small retail operations, closed and consolidated five domestic footwear factories and closed about 15 retail locations.  Reuter '},\n",

              "  'BODY': \"Iraq said today its warplnes had attacked a supertanker and four Iranian oil sites and vowed to keep up such raids until the Gulf war ends.     The surprise escalation of attacks on oil installations broke more than a month-long lull in Iraqi air force action.     It also followed celebrations yesterday of what Baghdad hailed as Iran's failure to achieve victory during the Iranian year which ended on Saturday.     A high command communique said warplanes hit the western jetty at Iran's Kharg island oil terminal in the afternoon and struck a supertanker nearby at the same time.     The Kharg terminal, attacked about 135 times since August 1985, was last raided in January.     The communique did not identify the supertanker, but said columns of smoke were seen billowing from it.     In London, Lloyds insurance said the 162,046-ton Iranian tanker Avaj was hit on Saturday, when Iraq reported an earlier Gulf attack.     But there has been no independent confirmation of today's supertanker attack nor of other raids on shipping reported by Baghdad in the past 24 hours.     The last confirmed Iraqi attack took place on March eight, when the Iranian tanker Khark-5 was hit south of Kharg.     Iraqi warplanes also struck Iran's offshore oilfields at Nowruz, Cyrus and Ardeshir in northern gulf, some 80 km (50 miles) west of Kharg island, today's communique said.     The three oilfields have been raided several times in the past three years. Oil sources said they were not crucially important to Iran's oil export trade.     A second high command communique today said Iraqi warplanes flew 94 sorties against Iranan targets and positions at the war front.     It also reported a clash between Iraqi naval units and several Iranian boats carrying men to attack an Iraqi oil terminal at the northen tip of the Gulf.

              "  'BODY': 'Takeover speculation buoyed Wendy\\'s International Inc\\'s stock, even after Coca Cola Co took the fizz out of market rumors by denying it was an interested suitor.     Wendy\\'s retreated from an earlier high of 13-3/8, and lost a point when Coca Cola <KO> said the rumors were untrue. However, Wendy\\'s remained up 5/8 at 12-3/8 on volume of more than three mln shares.     Several analysts were skeptical of the rumors, yet they said they could not conclude a takeover of the fast food restaurant chain was impossible.     Wendy\\'s declined comment on takeover rumors of all kinds. Yet, a Wendy\\'s spokesman said the company was aware of a Business Week article, which named Coke as a potential suitor and which market sources said helped ignite the rumor mill.     Market sources mentioned Anheuser-Busch Inc <BUD> and Pepsico Inc <PEP> as alternatives to Coke as acquirers. Neither of those companies would comment, nor would the Wendy\\'s official.     \"It doesn\\'t happen every day, every week, every month, but its not unusual for us to be linked with those companies,\" said Denny Lynch, Wendy\\'s vice president of communications.     However, Lynch would not comment specifically on the current market rumors.     Even before Coke denied the rumors, analysts had been skeptical of a takeover since Atlanta-based Coke has stated it views fast food chains as customers and does not want to become a competitor to them.     \"I can\\'t put another name on it,\" said Kidder peabody analyst Jay Freedman as vaguer rumors continued to hold up Wendy\\'s stock. \"It very well could be someone\\'s interested.\"     But Freedman said he doesn\\'t believe now is the right time for Wendy\\'s to be sold.     \"They\\'re obviously having operational difficulties. I\\'ve always believed at the right price Wendy\\'s would consider (an offer), but I can\\'t believe this is the right price at the right time,\" Freedman said.     \"If a transaction takes place, the buyer\\'s going to control the situation,\" Freedman said.     \"I just don\\'t think there\\'s anything going on. I don\\'t think it\\'s worth much more than where it is,\" said Joseph Doyle of Smith Barney.     Analysts said Wendy\\'s has suffered largely from the \"burger wars\" between itself, McDonald\\'s Corp <MCD> and Pillsbury Co\\'s <PSY> Burger King chain. Wendy\\'s, the third largest fast food hamburger chain in the U.S., lost about 11 pct in same store sales last year, analysts said.     Wendy\\'s also fumbled when it introduced a high-priced breakfast, which it has since withdrawn, analysts said. Some analysts said the company should be bringing in new products, but it is too soon to predict a significant turnaround.     There are analysts, however, who believe Wendy\\'s may be vulnerable to a takeover.     James Murren of C.J. Lawrence said Wendy\\'s could be worth 14 to 15 dlrs on a break-up basis. He said the company has improved its debt-to-equity ratio and Wendy\\'s owns a high percent of its own restaurants - 38 pct of 3,500.     \"They also have some attractive leaseholds on their restaurants,\" Murren said.     Murren said that despite the downturn in sales last year, Wendy\\'s real sales, store for store, turned upwards in the fourth quarter. \"That was about the first time in seven quarters,\" he said.     Caroline Levy of E.F. Hutton also believes something could be going on with Wendy\\'s. \"My gut feeling is something\\'s going to happen. I don\\'t know what,\" she said.     She estimated a takeover price would be at least 15 dlrs per share.     One analyst speculated that Coke became the rumored suitor because Wendy\\'s decided to sell Coke at its fountains instead of Pepsi.     Wendy\\'s is currently embroiled in litigation brought by Pepsi, which holds a contract with the company, analysts said. Pepsi\\'s soda is still sold in the Wendy\\'s restaurants.  Reuter '},\n",

All this produce will be imported into Spain at special levy levels likely to be below those applying for imports into other EC countries.     The sources said it was possible that the Spanish intervention board would be asked to buy the produce directly this year, as it was rather late to make other arrangements.     They added that the choice for future years appears to lie between a system of regular tenders and the setting of a daily special levy applicable to Spanish imports.

The bank's parent company gross operating profits were up 5.4 pct at 21.34 billion francs against 20.24 billion in 1985.

Bankers, attending the Inter-American Development Bank annual meeting here, said the two sides are still working on a plan that embraces Manila's proposal to pay interest partly with Philippine investment notes (PIN) instead of cash.     One senior banker said he hoped that final agreement would be reached this week but cautioned that a number of major issues are still outstanding.     The senior banker said that the remaining issues include interest rates and the exact form of the investment notes plan.     However, bankers did not anticipate any accounting problems for this novel interest payment method.     Deputy U.S. Comptoller of the Currency Robert Bench said last week that U.S. bank regulators also had no objection in principle to the PINs concept because Manila has guaranteed their ready conversion into cash.

              "  'BODY': 'Slow progress in talks between Brazil and its major foreign creditors has increased the likelihood that U.S. banks will declare their loans to Brazil non-performing at the end of the quarter, bankers said.     Several banks, citing Brazil\\'s suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of its 108 billion dlr foreign debt and the absence of a coherent economic plan, have already said they might take such a step, even though it would cost them tens of millions of dollars in profits.     An inconclusive meeting here March 22 between central bank governor Francisco Gros and Brazil\\'s bank advisory committee can only have stiffened that resolve.     A nasty row is also looming over 16 billion dlrs of trade and money-market lines which Brazil froze last month.     The legal commitment to maintain these credits runs out on March 31, and the worried talk at the Inter-American Development Bank annual meeting here is that some disgruntled bank will sue for repayment, raising the specter of a cascade of lawsuits and tit-for-tat asset seizures.     \"My gut feeling is that common sense will prevail. But is there a risk? Yes, the mood out there is pretty nasty,\" one New York banker commented.     Two or three years ago, a showdown between the world\\'s largest debtor and its largest creditors would have sent shock waves through the financial markets. But no longer.     Some U.S. money-center bank stocks fell by about 10 pct in the immediate aftermath of Brazil\\'s payments halt. But, in the Eurodeposit markets, which bankers consider to be the most sensitive gauge of confidence, there was no discernible flight out of bank instruments and into safer government bonds.     In fact, the system has calmly withstood the suspension, in part or in full, of interest payments by countries owing about 150 billion dlrs of the region\\'s total foreign debt of 380 billion.     Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Costa Rica, Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua had all curtailed payments before Brazil.     The explanation for the fairly relaxed view is that net new bank lending to Latin America has dried up at the same time as banks have steadily bolstered their capital base. As a result, exposure relative to capital has fallen and few now fear for the collapse of a major bank.     That is why, banking analysts have said, Citicorp <CCI> felt emboldened to state early in the day that it might put Brazil on a cash basis even before interest becomes 90 days overdue. It would forfeit 190 mln dlrs of profits this year as a result, but for a company which earned over a billion dlrs in 1986 the setback would be manageable.     Some other banks are not as strong, however, and a protracted confrontation with Brazil could still seriously erode depositor and investor confidence, especially if other debtors are emboldened to follow suit and press for debt relief.     Bankers are thus working hard to isolate Brazil. Financing agreements were reached recently with Chile and Venezuela, an accord with the Philippines seems to be close at hand, and a deal with Argentina on new loans and a debt restructuring could be reached in the next two weeks, bankers say.     In taking a hard line against wholesale debt relief, the banks have the clear backing of the Reagan Administration. \"All of us have a stake in the stability of the world banking system - a debt forgiveness plan that damages commercial banks also weakens confidence in world financial stability,\" U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker told the IADB meeting.     Some European bankers, however, argue that capitalization of interest is already happening in practice and that the banks ought to face up to the fact and work with the debtors on longer-term solutions that recognize that not all the interest can be paid back right away.     Rigid accounting rules have prevented U.S. banks from seriously considering adding interest to the principal of a loan because they would have to declare the loan non-performing. But, Brazilian central bank governor Gros said, if the banks are now volunteering to take that step, they might be more willing to discuss new ideas for debt relief.     \"It\\'s not necessarily an unfavorable development,\" Gros said when asked about the prospect of Brazilian loans being put on a cash basis.     \"We find more room to discuss these things (innovations) with European banks which have already bitten the bullet.\"      What is clear, however, is that banks are so angry and frustrated with Brazil that they are in no mood to offer quick concessions.     A long war of attrition on the debt front lies ahead.  Reuter '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'International Business Machines Corp, hit by a two-year earnings slump, should begin a come-back by the end of 1987 and post strong growth in 1988, analyst Rick Martin of Sanford C. Bernstein Co Inc said.     \"There will be increasing momentum in earnings, albeit not until later this year,\" Martin said at a technology conference sponsored by the investment firm.     Martin said the coming rebound reflects new product introductions in the mid-range area, rather than any drastic improvement in economic growth or U.S. capital spending.     IBM, whose stock hit a 52-week low of 115-3/4 dlrs in mid-January, has come back lately. IBM was trading up 7/8 at 149-1/2 dlrs.     Analysts, computer industry executives, and the company itself, have highlighted the external economic factors hampering IBM\\'s growth.     But Martin said the product cycle was key to understanding the rise and fall of IBM and other computer companies, and pointed to Digital Equipment Corp <DEC> to support his view. \"By replacing the product line, earnings have soared,\" he said of DEC\\'s line of VAX computers.     In contrast to DEC, IBM faultered with an incompatible mid-range product line. A new computer code-named \"Fort Knox\" was supposed to tie together a number of IBM\\'s mid-range systems, but the product never got off the ground, he said.     Instead, aspects of the computer were integrated into the IBM 9370 machine introduced last year, and other aspects should be unwrapped by 1988, Martin said. \"The major story will be a rebound in its mid-range business.\"     He said sales of IBM\\'s mid-range computers fell about 13 pct in 1986. But the new products will lead to 5.8 pct growth in mid-range computers this year and 30.7 pct growth in 1988.     High-end computers, primarily the Sierra line, are coming to the end of their product life cycle. Although growing 22.5 pct in the midst of IBM\\'s sharply lower 1986 year, growth will drop to 1.5 pct in 1987 and 1.9 pct in 1988, he said.     By 1988, overall revenue growth should rise to about 16 pct, against 5.8 pct growth in 1987 and 2.4 pct in 1986, Martin said. Last year, IBM earned 4.8 billion dlrs on revenues of 51.3 billion dlrs.     Investors asked what this all meant to DEC, whose earnings and stock have been propelled by a strong slew of product introductions in the mid-range area.     In response, Martin said he did not view IBM as a threat to DEC, nor DEC as a threat to IBM, because both companies were catering largely to existing customer bases, rather than stealing market share from one another.

He declined to be more specific.     In the 1986 first quarter, Brunswick reported earnings of 23.8 mln dlrs or 57 cts a share on sales of 396.7 mln dlrs.     Reichart noted that results of its two newly-acquired boat manufacturing companies will be included in the company\\'s first quarter report.     Brunswick expects its recreation centers to benefit from increased attention to the sport of bowling resulting from acceptance in the 1988 Summer Olympics of bowling as an exhibition sport and as a medal sport in the 1991 Pan American Games, he said.     He said field testing of a new bowling concept involving electronic features is being readied for test marketing this summer, and if successful, could \"materially benefit\" operations.     Brunswick is currently test marketing in California a health club facility adjoining a bowling center, he said.     Turning to its defense operations, Reichert said he expects the division to receive significant contracts in the near future. At 1986 year end, Brunswick\\'s defense contract backlog stood at 425 mln dlrs.     Frederick Florjancic, vice president-finance, told analysts Brunswick was disappointed two credit rating services recently downgraded the company\\'s debt which stood at about 665.4 mln dlrs at 1986 year end.     \"We are confident we can service our debt and bring it down in the very near term,\" based on strong cash flow from Brunswick\\'s expanded boat operations, Florjancic said.

              "  'BODY': 'Congress should give the U.S. Agriculture Secretary the authority to keep the 1987 soybean loan rate at the current effective rate of 4.56 dlrs per bushel in order to help resolve the problem of soybean export competitiveness, USDA undersecretary Dan Amstutz said.     Speaking to reporters following a Senate Agriculture Appropriations hearing, Amstutz suggested that one way out of the current soybean program \"dilemma\" would be for Congress to allow the loan rate to remain at 4.56 dlrs. He indicated if the loan rate were 4.56 dlrs, USDA could then consider ways to make U.S. soybeans more competitive such as using certificates to further buydown the loan rate.     Under current law, the 1987 soybean loan rate cannot be less than 4.77 dlrs per bu.     Amstutz\\' suggestion would be for Congress to change the farm bill to allow USDA to leave the soybean loan rate at 4.56 dlrs in crop year 1987 rather than increase it to 4.77 dlrs.     The 1986 effective loan rate is 4.56 dlrs because of the 4.3 pct Gramm-Rudman budget cut.     Amstutz stressed that a major factor in any decision on soybean program changes will be the budget costs.     He told the hearing that the problem in soybeans is that the U.S. loan rate provides an \"umbrella\" to foreign production and causes competitive problems for U.S. soybeans.     Asked about the American Soybean Association\\'s request for some form of income support, Amstutz said \"the competitive problem is the most severe.\" He said USDA is still studying the situation and \"no resolution\" has yet been found.

              "  'BODY': 'U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said leading Latin American nations have delayed accepting a U.S. compromise proposal on major reforms of the Inter-American Development Bank.     In an interview with a small group of reporters, Baker said discussions on far-reaching reforms of the bank would resume around the fringes of the semiannual meeting of the International Monetary Fund in two weeks time.     But Baker said his compromise proposal, which he would not disclose, was no longer on the table.     \"I made it clear that the proposal was not one that I expected to leave out there if we could not resolve it at this meeting,\" Baker said.     The U.S. had pressed for virtual veto power over IADB loans which were made on terms Washington considers far too lax.     In a bid to integrate the Bank into the U.S. debt strategy, Washington has suggested it would be ready to subscribe nine billion dlrs to a new four-year capital replenishment of the Bank.     In return Latin nations would have to give up their 54 pct simple majority voting power over IADB lending.     Baker said, \"In my view, they have not rejected it out of hand at all and that it will be considered, should we choose to advance it at the April meeting.\"     A U.S. contribution of that size would lead to an effective four-year lending program by the Bank of 22.9 billion dlrs.     The actual capital increase would amount to 27 billion dlrs, but usable resources would be less because the callable capital of Latin debtors is theoretical and does not take place in practice, U.S. officials explained.     In return Latin nations would have to give up their 54 pct simple majority voting power over IADB lending.     Initially, the U.S. wanted 65 pct of votes to proceed with a loan, a position that would have given the U.S. a virtual veto since it holds almost 35 pct of the votes.     But it seemed clear from Baker\\'s remarks he was at one point ready to concede an increased voting power, such as 62.5 pct or 60 pct as the majority for approving loans, that would amount to a compromise between the original U.S. and Latin American positions.     Baker said, \"In my view, they have not rejected it out of hand at all and that it will be considered, should we choose to advance it at the April meeting.\"     Baker made clear that since Mexico, Brazil, Venezuela and Argentina, representing the Latins, had declined to accept the plan today, the U.S. had reverted to its original position, but he added, \"It\\'s possible the proposal could be revived.\"     U.S. officials, who asked not to be named, said they believed a decision was not forthcoming because several top Latin finance officials were absent from the IADB annual meetings here.     And one official added that the key Latin officials would be present at the semi-annual meetings of the IMF and the World Bank.     The Treasury Secretary warned that if the issue is left unresolved \"we can\\'t look towards a greater (capital) replenishment here.\"     That would mean the U.S. would use another multilateral development bank, like the World Bank, as its principal vehicle for lending tied to fundamental economic reforms in debtor nations.     The IADB has tended to make loans for projects rather than sectoral loans aimed at reforming Latin economies and hence has never fully participated in Baker\\'s third world debt plan.  Reuter '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'American Express Co said its board approved a public offering of about 18 pct of its wholly owned Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit.     American Express also approved the previously announced plan to sell about 13 pct, or 13 mln convertible preferred, of the unit to Nippon Life insurance co for 538 mln dlrs. The preferred shares are convertible to the same number of common shares following Hart-Scott-Rodino and FDIC approvals.     American Express said it will maintain 60 pct, or 60 mln of the 100 mln shares of Shearson that will be outstanding.     American Express said it had agreed with Nippon life that American Express will hold a minimum of 40 pct of Shearson until January, 1999.    American Express said 7.5 mln Shearson shares would be held by certain employees of Shearson and one mln by a Shearson stock ownership plan to be formed.     American Express said it anticipates a registration statement for the public offering will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission shortly.     American Express also declared a two-for-one stock split and raised its quarterly dividend to 38 cts per share from 36 cts on a pre-split basis. Both dividends are payable May 8, to shareholders of record April 3. There are currently 215 mln American Express shares outstanding.     The transaction with Nippon Life remains subject to approval by the Japanese ministry of finance, which is expected in April.     American Express also said an agreement was reached by Shearson and Nippon Life providing for a joint venture in London.     The venture will focus on investment advisory asset management, market research and consulting on financing. It also said it expects the relationship to extend to selected projects involving American Express, Shearson Lehman and Nippon Life in key financial centers of Asia and other regions, and to future personnel exchanges.     Under the agreement, Nippon will receive 13 mln cumulative preferred shares with a five pct dividend rate. The cumulative preferred stock will become convertible with voting powers to an equal number of common shares following the U.S. government approvals.     American Express said that assuming conversion of the preferred stock held by Nippon, 100 mln shares of Shearson Lehman common stock would be outstanding. For the public offering, it said there will be an underwriters overallotment option to purchase 1.8 mln shares.     American Express will also grant Nippon Life a five-year warrant to purchase one mln American Express common shares at 100 dlrs per share. There are currently 215 mln American Express shares outstanding.     Nippon Life would be entitled to nominate two directors to the Shearson board and one representative to serve as an adviser to the American Express board of directors.     \"These proposed transactions are yet another signal that american express intends to stay in the forefront of the financial services industry worldwide,\" said American Express Chairman James D. Robinson. \"The implementation of our plans, moreover, will enable us to maintain a majority interest in shearson while enhancing the strength of our balance sheet by tapping additional capital resources for shearson outside american express.\" Reuter...

              "  'BODY': 'Foreign currency futures markets would not be harmed if the leading industrial countries agreed to restrict currency movements to within a narrow band, said Leo Melamed, chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange\\'s, CME, executive committee.     \"The target zone would not affect our market I think at all.... A 10 pct range in the Deutsche mark gives us a healthy market,\" Melamed told Reuters in an interview.     \"We were willing to live in the old Smithsonian era with a four pct shift,\" he said, referring to permitted currency fluctuations in the early 1970s. \"One thing you can adjust is to make each contract a larger value.\"     As chairman of the CME in 1969-71, Melamed was instrumental in the development of currency futures, which now are crucial to the Chicago exchange.     Melamed said capital flows -- which he estimated can approach 200 billion dlrs a day -- would overwhelm efforts by governments to control currency fluctuations.     \"They can do it for a day, in terms of intervention, an hour, a week maybe, but not over a period of time. So it\\'s unrealistic and it doesn\\'t work and it\\'s unnecessary.\"     The CME\\'s top policymaker also said a decision by the exchange to advance the quarterly settlement time of its stock index futures contract to the morning from the afternoon would help eliminate dramatic price gyrations in futures and equity markets on so-called \"triple-witching\" day.     \"We think that the settlement in the morning will have a salutary effect so that over a longer period of time I think this issue (triple witching) will go away because of the change in the structure as of next June,\" when the move is scheduled to go into effect, he said.     Melamed said proposed changes in floor practices by traders of the popular Standard and Poor\\'s 500 stock index future would address complaints of trading abuses and stimulate trading.     Two weeks ago, the CME board of directors proposed barring brokers on the top step of the pit from trading for their own account. The board also proposed requiring brokers engaged in dual trading elsewhere in the pit to record personal trades to the nearest minute and curbing trading between broker groups.     The changes \"will in time have an extremely positive effect on the marketplace. That\\'s going to prove very, very instrumental in increasing volume over time,\" he said, predicting the increase would come within a year.     Melamed, also chairman of Dellsher Investment Co Inc, said the CME last week withdrew a proposal to put a 12-point limit on the S and P 500 index\\'s daily price movement when the Commodity Futures Trading Commission told the exchange it could not be a temporary program.     The CME also received \"many negative comments, many more than we anticipated,\" Melamed conceded. Many futures commission merchants predicted sell orders would accelerate in the event the price approached the bottom limit.  Reuter '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'US Sprint, the 50-50 telephone venture of GTE Corp <GTE> and United Telecommunications Inc <UT> set up last June, is optimistic despite expecting to report a net loss of about 500 mln dlrs this year.      David M. Holland, president of US Sprint\\'s Dallas-based Southwest Division, told Reuters in an interview that he did not know what it would report for the first quarter, but agreed that for the year the company should have about the same results as last year when it lost \"about 500 mln dlrs.\"      He noted the company was slated to spend 2.3 billion dlrs over \"two plus years\" to set up its network.      Holland added that Sprint was still paying almost 500 mln dlrs a year to American Telephone and Telegraph Co (T) in order to lease its lines.      He said 16,000 miles of its 23,000 mile fiber optic telephone line are now \"in the ground,\" and 7,000 miles are operable.      By the end of the year, he said, 90 pct of the company\\'s subscribers will be carried on its fiber optic lines (instead of leased ATT lines), compared with 60 pct by the end of the second quarter.     Fiber optic lines, which send digital light impulses along microscopic glass lines, is quicker, more accurate and more economical than traditional copper cables. A fiber optic line the diameter of a dime can carry the same amount of information as a copper cable 20 feet in diameter.      \"By the end of the year, we will have the capacity to carry 50 pct of all U.S. long distance phone calls,\" Holland said.     He said ATT currently controls about 80 pct of the U.S. long distance market, with MCI Communications Corp <MCIC> about 10 to 12 pct and Sprint five to seven pct.      Holland said Sprint\\'s rates, which were 50 pct lower than ATT when it did not pay to gain access to local telephone exchanges, were now about 10 to 12 pct lower now that all the companies have equal access. He said the company was cutting back its advertising by about 30 pct this year.      At the same time, he said Sprint had increased its total number of customers to four mln from two mln from July 1986 to last January.     \"We\\'ve captured the fiber high ground, shown the importance of it,\" he said.      Concerning the deregulation of ATT, Holland said he believed ATT \"should be given some flexibility, but should be regulated on pricing plans.\"      \"They\\'re so dominant in the market place,\" he said, adding that ATT should be deregulated when \"there is true competition in the marketplace.\"      \"It takes time to prove ourselves and a lot of money,\" he said, adding, \"maybe two to four years out, it\\'s hard to say.\"     Holland said he was not concerned about talk that Sprint\\'s two owners might be squabbling or that corporate raiders, such as the Belzberg family in Canada, might be putting pressure on them to sell off their loss-making Sprint holdings.      \"They are two excellent partners who have stated time and time again their support of US Sprint,\" he said, adding that he was \"amazed\" at industry talk that the two companies might be arguing. \"There\\'s no evidence of that,\" he said.      He said Sprint\\'s progress in such areas as revenues, number of customers and construction was on track, even \"ahead in many areas.\"     Looking beyond the United States, Holland said Sprint currently had direct access to 34 countries and aimed to be in 90 pct of the Free World nations by 1988.     \"We want to be in every country that ATT serves,\" he said.     He said Sprint currently does not have access to Mexico but was working on it.      He noted negotiations between Mexico and GTE Sprint, the forerunner of US Sprint, had been broken off by the September 1985 earthquake which had devastated the nation\\'s telephone network.

              "  'BODY': 'Britain has reaped profits by using a stronger pound to buy back dollars used by the government last autumn to support sterling during a currency crisis, Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said.     He said in a parliamentary debate, \"I can now tell the House (of Commons) that the dollars that were sold from the reserves in September and October (1986) have subsequently all been repurchased - at a profit of some tens of millions of pounds.\"     Hindsight had proved him right to resist market pressures then for a two percentage point interest rate rise, he said. The increase in base rates was instead limited then to one point.     During a debate on the 1987/88 British budget which Lawson unveiled last week, he said that \"during the period of foreign exchange market turbulence which followed the somewhat inconclusive Group of Five and Group of Seven meetings at the end of September, I authorised the Bank of England to intervene unusually heavily in order to buy breathing space that would enable me to confine the interest rate rise to one pct rather than the two pct the market was then pressing for.\"     He said that that one percentage point increase, effected in October 1986, had been reversed by this month\\'s two half point cuts in banks\\' base lending rates. They are now at 10 pct.     Treasury figures show that the underlying change in British reserves - seen as a guide to possible Bank of England intervention on foreign exchange markets - suggest that the authorities sold around 1.0 billion dlrs during September and October 1986, government sources said.

              "  'BODY': 'British manufacturers expect output to grow rapidly in the four coming months, a Confederation of British Industry (CBI) survey shows.     The CBI\\'s monthly trends survey for March shows that 43 pct of the 1,685 polled U.K. Firms expect to raise output in the next four months. Only nine pct expect output to fall while 47 pct said production would likely remain unchanged.     The CBI said the positive balance between firms expecting production to rise and those forecasting a fall, at 34 pct, was the highest such figure recorded since 1977.     In the CBI\\'s February survey, 37 pct of companies expected a rise in output while 54 pct forecast production would remain at present levels and eight pct expected production to drop.     The survey also showed that 23 pct of the polled companies consider current order books to be above normal while 58 pct view them as normal and only 19 pct regard them as below normal.     This was the highest positive balance since the question was first asked more than 10 years ago, the CBI said.     In February, the figures were 24 pct, 22 pct and 54 pct respectively.     Companies also rated their export possibilities higher. Of all polled companies, 23 pct rated their export order books to be above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only 23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels.     In February, 25 pct thought their export books were below normal and 50 pct believed them to be about normal. At 23 pct, the proportion of companies rating their export books above normal was unchanged between February and March.     On prices, the survey showed that 62 pct of companies expect average prices at which domestic orders are booked will remain unchanged in the coming four months, up from 57 pct in February.     From 38 pct in February, only 31 pct of firms now expect prices to rise before July. Six pct forecast prices will fall, against four pct a month earlier.     Commenting on the survey, CBI economic situation committee chairman David Wigglesworth said sterling\\'s more competitive level against many European currencies had improved exports.     \"But interest rates are still much higher than in our competitor countries and British manufacturers will still have to work hard to win new business both in overseas markets and in the substitution of British-made goods for imports here at home,\" he said.

              "  'BODY': 'U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).     Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture.     Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September.     Yeutter said \"at least people seem to be going down the same road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely.\"     There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and \"a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there,\" Yeutter said.     However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead, he said.     \"It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy,\" he said.     He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he said.     Individual segments in many countries may lose in the process, but it should result in a more rational system of world-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said.     It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26 billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more than that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources, he said.     Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations, he said \"one has to be politically realistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural trade reform) done in two to three years it\\'s going to have to be as part of a larger package.\"  REUTER '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'Swire Pacific Ltd <SWPC.HKG> is likely to show a more than 20 pct rise in 1986 operating profits when it reports results tomorrow, reflecting gains in its aviation and property businesses, share analysts said.     Analysts polled by Reuters estimated after-tax profits from operations will be between 1.525 billion and 1.8 billion dlrs compared with 1.23 billion in 1985.     They also said Swire will have an extraordinary gain of about 1.38 billion dlrs from the flotation of its Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd <CAPH.HKG> unit last May.     Swire had an extraordinary gain of 59.1 mln dlrs in 1985.     Share analysts said Swire will set a 36 cent final dividend for its \"A\" shares, making a total of 54 cents, after 47 cents adjusted for a two-for-one bonus issue in 1985.     Aviation and properties together account for 75 pct of the company\\'s net asset value and about 85 pct of its net profits, analysts said.     The company\\'s aviation division consists of its majority stake in Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd and its 25 pct interest in <Hongkong Aircraft Engineering Co Ltd>, which is also 25 pct owned by Cathay.     Cathay last week reported 1986 profits climbed to 1.23 billion dlrs from 777 mln in 1985, partly because of lower fuel costs and greater traffic.     Swire\\'s share of Cathay, which stood at 70 pct before the flotation, fell to 54.25 pct at the end of last year and has since slipped to 50.23 pct.     Hongkong Aircraft reported this month its 1986 net profits rose 29.5 pct to 115.5 mln dlrs.     Tony Measor, an analyst at Hong Leong Securities Ltd, estimates Swire\\'s profits will be 1.525 billion dlrs.     \"Much depends on properties,\" said Measor. \"And they did a lot better in the second half of the year.\"     Estimates of profits from the firm\\'s wholly owned Swire Properties Ltd unit range widely from 500 mln dlrs to 700 mln compared with 570 mln dlrs in 1985.     Swire Properties recorded an interim profit of 120 mln dlrs for the first half of 1986, well below 260 mln dlrs for the same 1985 period, but analysts said that was due mainly to the low level of completion of new residential flats. The firm\\'s properties consist mainly of the Taikoo Shing residential development and two luxury housing projects.     Hoare Govett Asia Ltd said the completion of 1,100 flats in Taikoo Shing will have yielded profits of 300 mln dlrs in second-half 1986.     During the year property prices continued to rise as more people bought real estate, benefiting from low interest rates, analysts said.     \"At the end of last year, flats in Taikoo Shing were selling at 1,100 dlrs per square foot, up by about 20 pct from a year ago,\" said Frederick Tsang of Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd.     Swire is developing a large commercial and hotel complex in the central business district of Hong Kong but it will not provide income until the first stage is completed next year.     The company also sold three properties and a part interest in a proposed hotel development, which should result in extraordinary gains of 60 mln dlrs in 1986, according to James Capel (Far East) Ltd.     Swire\\'s trading and manufacturing operations are expected to earn 300 mln dlrs, up 22 pct from 1985 but its shipping and offshore services are likely to post a small loss of about 10 mln dlrs because of depressed market conditions.

Official figures show the latest level compares with the previous record of 51 billion dlrs on March 4 and about 26 billion in late March 1986.     Central bank Governor Chang Chi-cheng told reporters the increase in reserves was the result of heavy intervention by the bank on the local interbank market. It bought nearly two billion U.S. Dlrs between March 5 and 23, he said.     Wang Chao-ming, vice chairman of the government\\'s Council for Economic Planning and Development, told Reuters the rising reserves were \"a big headache for Taiwan.\"     He said the government expects heavier pressure from the U.S., Where protectionist bills are being proposed against nations such as Taiwan and Japan with large trade surpluses with the U.S.     Wang said the government would launch new measures within the next two months to further reduce import tariffs and open the market wider to foreign products, especially those from the U.S.     Wang said the measures aim at helping reduce Taiwan\\'s trade surplus, which rose to 2.73 billion U.S. Dlrs in the first two months of 1987 from 2.02 billion a year earlier. Nearly 90 pct of the surplus was with the U.S.     Vice Economic Minister Wang Chien-shien agreed with Wang\\'s remarks and said efforts to avert U.S. Protectionism were running out of time. \"We must do it quickly or face retaliation from Washington,\" he said.     He said the measures would include removal of trade barriers on insurance and inland services for U.S. Companies.     Chang Chi-cheng said the central bank could not stop buying U.S. Dollars because of heavy sales by local exporters who fear the strong local dollar will cause them exchange losses.     He said the bank is studying revision of the foreign exchange rules in hope of further reducing currency controls, but declined to give details.     The Taiwan dollar has risen about 15 pct against the U.S. Dollar since September 1985.

              "  'BODY': 'Australia\\'s crude oil tax strategy is probably best tackled in terms of a targeted rather than broadly-based approach, Federal Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans told a meeting here.     He told the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) annual conference there was a prospect of developing a package that would recognise the government\\'s economic priorities while also meeting some of the industry\\'s concerns.     Evans was referring to a nearly completed government review of oil taxation.     Evans said there were plenty of examples where targeted approaches to oil industry taxation had produced good results in recent years.     These include the reduction in the top marginal crude excise rate on \\'old\\' Bass Strait oil found before September 1975 to 80 pct from 87 pct, and the waiver of excise on onshore oil announced last September, he said.     The industry, through the APEA, has been calling for the elimination of secondary taxation on oil in order to boost incentives for prospecting against a background of weak prices and Australia\\'s relatively low exploration levels.     \"While nobody wants to add further unnecessary complexity to an already complex taxation regime, I am inclined to favour these kinds of tailored approaches ahead of sweeping changes, which leave (government) revenue much reduced and may still leave a lot of uncertainty as to what individual companies are going to do in major areas,\" Evans said.     He said the government did not intend to change its resource rent taxation (RRT) legislation, now before parliament, in response to industry calls to allow all exploration expenditure in a given area to be deductible.     As previously reported, RRT is a tax of 40 pct limited to highly prospective offshore areas, based on profits after a certain rate of return has been achieved for individual projects.     APEA has said it is not a true profit-based tax because exploration deductibility is limited to successful projects.     Evans said the decision not to change RRT was based more than anything on the government\\'s desire to ensure the certainty and stability of the new regime, adding that major investments have already been planned on the existing ground rules.

Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient.     \"That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round,\" he said. \"The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems.\"     The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time.     The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed, he said.     \"Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that\\'s the basic objective of the new GATT round,\" he said.

Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled meeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Council to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact with the U.S.     That pact, agreed last year after months of negotiations, calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors.

              "  'BODY': 'World Bank president Barber Conable pledged the Bank\\'s support to help Indonesia adjust to lower world oil prices, but said further deregulation of its protected economy was needed.     Speaking to reporters after talks with President Suharto, he said he expected Jakarta to do more to liberalise the economy and deregulate trade policy.     Indonesia, hurt by the fall in oil prices last year which cut the value of its crude exports in half, is the Third World\\'s sixth largest debtor. It has received 10.7 billion dlrs from the World Bank in the past 20 years.     Conable said the World Bank, which granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr loan last month to help its balance of payments, was prepared to back Jakarta in taking the right steps to adjust to lower oil and primary commodity prices.     \"We are prepared to support those steps which we believe are consistent with the development of the Indonesian economy,\" he said.     He said Jakarta\\'s willingness to move quickly after last year\\'s collapse in oil price saved Indonesia from some of the difficulties now faced by other countries.     Indonesia devalued its currency by 31 pct against the dollar in September to avoid a balance of payments crisis, and has announced a series of measures since May intended to stimulate exports, encourage foreign investment and revitalise the economy.     However, key monopolies in areas like steel and plastics and high tariff barriers remain in place.     Conable arrived in Indonesia on Saturday and has since met 14 Indonesian cabinet ministers to review the country\\'s borrowing needs and the impact of falling oil prices on the country.

              "  'BODY': 'Bank of Japan Governor Satoshi Sumita said in a statement the central bank will intervene in foreign exchange markets to stabilise exchange rates if necessary in close cooperation with other major industrial nations.     Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including market intervention, if necessary, in line with the February 22 Paris agreement by six major industrial nations.     Canada, Britain, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around current levels. Sumita\\'s statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40.     \"It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates,\" Sumita said.

              "  'BODY': \"Industrial holding company Williams Holdings Plc said it was bidding 542.2 mln stg for the ordinary shares of building products and packaging group Norcros Plc.     The offer would be made on the basis of 29 new Williams shares for every 50 in Norcros, or 432.7p a share     Norcros shares firmed to 410p at 0914 GMT from a close last night of 397p.     A statement by Williams said it was confident of the merits of the proposed merger and it had therefore taken care to propose from the outset the right terms, including a full cash alternative.     The offer will include a partial convertible alternative under which shareholders would receive up to a total of 205.69 mln new second convertible shares in Williams instead of their ordinary share allocations.     The offer for Norcros preferential shares offers one Williams preferential share for each one of Norcros, for a value of 130p each and a total of 2.9 mln stg.     Last week Williams reported that pretax profits for 1986 rose to 22.9 mln stg from 6.3 mln.     Speculation about a bid for Norcros had been circulating in the market for several months, dealers said. Initially it centred on <Bunzl Plc>, which once held a 2.6 pct stake, then switched to Williams when it began accumulating shares.     Earlier this year, Williams suggested holding talks with Norcros on a possible merger but was rebuffed by Norcros which replied that any benefits that could be achieved could also result from normal trading.     In the six months to end-September, Norcros reported a rise in pretax profits to 20.14 mln stg from 18.55 mln on turnover that lifted to 311.82 mln from 303.91 mln     Williams Holdings began expanding from 1982 when it had a market capitalisation of around one mln stg. A series of acquisitions in the next four years has pushed its capitalisation up to around 380 mln.     The convertible offer would be on the basis of four Williams convertibles for every Norcros share, worth 428p a share. The cash alternative would offer the equivalent of 400.2p a share.     The announcement of the bid pushed Williams share price down to 733p from last night's close at 750p.     Williams said it held a total 850,000 shares in Norcros, or 0.7 pct, while an associate held a further 1.99 mln or 1.6 pct.     There was no immediate response from Norcros.  REUTER \"},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'The dollar is expected to decline further in coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of last month\\'s Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates, senior foreign exchange dealers said.     Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen, dealers said they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of 147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down. Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month\\'s accord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the dollar down, the dealers said.     \"The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for major currencies has cast a shadow on the agreement,\" said Koji Kidokoro, general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd\\'s treasury division.     He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S. Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of intervening to support the currency.     \"This eliminated the widespread market caution against possible joint central bank intervention,\" Kidokoro said.     Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward momentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardly contain a further slide in the currency.     They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5 billion dlrs today, including direct purchases through brokers, and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars through the U.S. Central bank in New York.     Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reserve would intervene on its own account to support the dollar, but some said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148 yen.     \"If the dollar drops to that low level, it could reduce the flow of foreign capital into U.S. Securities, which the Americans don\\'t want,\" said Haruya Uehara, chief money market manager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp.     He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month when corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close their books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31.     But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollar remained bearish. This was due to the lacklustre performance of the U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit and Japanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package.     \"The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan\\'s inertia in stimulating its economy,\" said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd\\'s international treasury division.     In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of economic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, to boost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce its trade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a sales tax.     In the circumstances the government had only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future, Dai-Ichi Kangyo\\'s Tanaka said.     Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the Japanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress would grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar.  REUTER '},\n",

The council said in a statement the industry was bitterly disappointed by the Australian government\\'s position on taxation, as presented in a speech by Resources and Energy Minister Gareth Evans to the APEA conference.     As earlier reported, Evans said he was inclined to target any tax changes rather than take a broad-based approach to secondary taxation of petroleum.     APEA had expected the government to make positive responses to detailed industry submissions seeking the removal of existing secondary tax disincentives to exploration and development, the council said.     It said it plans to reply in detail to issues raised by Evans, but its immediate concern was the decision to proceed with the current resource rental tax (RRT) legislation.     Evans told the conference the government did not plan to accept industry pleas for changes in the legislation to allow deductibility of unsuccessful exploration expenditure.     \"The government\\'s unwillingness to allow the deduction of unsuccessful exploration expenditure within the whole offshore area in which RRT applies negates any claim that the tax is profit based,\" the APEA council said.     The government missed a major opportunity to persuade oil exploration companies that it had realistic answers to the industry\\'s concerns, despite its recognition of the industry\\'s problems, the council said.     The industry has called for the end of all discriminatory secondary taxation of petroleum, citing them as major disincentives at a time of low oil prices.  REUTER '},\n",

The investment in one of Wall Street\\'s top brokerage houses is likely to pay off in dollars and international market position, they said. \"It\\'s part of a trend towards growing capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign financial institutions,\" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.     The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.     Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.     The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50 joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset management, market research, and consulting on financing.     Nippon Life is Japan\\'s largest insurance company and the world\\'s biggest institutional investor, analysts said.     The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.     The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese insurers\\' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year. Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and instruments.     Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co\\'s board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.     Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and problem-plagued banks in 1984. \"But now Japanese are going for blue-chip organisations,\" he said.     \"It\\'s a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing industries,\" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. \"With a historically high yen, and historically low interest rates, there\\'s an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.\"     Competition in fund management has grown along with greater Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17 to 18 pct, he said.     To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to spread to Japan with further deregulation. \"The high regulatory environment has delayed (life insurance firms\\') diversification. Now there\\'s a growing number of new products in an environment of increasing competition for performance on fund management,\" Smithson said.  REUTER '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'Leading Australian onshore oil and gas producer, Santos Ltd <STOS.S>, said its 1986 results were hit by sharp reductions in prices for crude oil, condensate and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).     The Cooper Basin producer earlier reported a fall in net profit to 88.67 mln dlrs from 144.04 mln in 1985.     Santos chairman Sir Brian Massy-Greene said in a statement that increased production, particularly of oil and LPG, along with reduced operating costs and reduced or deferred oil exploration and development outlays, were helping Santos deal with an adverse business climate.     Santos said it remained financially strong with an injection of 84 mln dlrs from the second instalment of a 1985 rights issue, and had cash reserves of 381.3 mln dlrs at the end of 1986 against 401.9 mln a year earlier.     It said it had also made significant progress in repaying debts and at year end the ratio of debt to shareholders\\' funds had fallen to 1.01 from 1.54.     Santos yesterday announced a 4.00 dlr a share takeover bid for the 96.93 pct it did not already hold in oil and gas company <TMOC Resources Ltd> -- valuing the target at 248.5 mln dlrs.     Santos said 75 pct of its loans were U.S. Dollar denominated and significant currency purchases were made during the year to maintain that natural hedge. At year end it held 145 mln U.S. Dlrs, enough to meet all 1987 repayments.     Santos said it had a successful gas exploration program, finding 172 billion cubic feet in South Australia, but oil exploration was less successful with 1.62 mln barrels added to reserves -- less than depletion during the year.     Cooper Basin producers are committed to a two-year scheme to double gas exploration while Santos said its 1987 budget for oil exploration had been boosted 20 pct.     Santos said the outlook for 1987 depended on prices and production volumes but with extra oil exploration and encouraging gas finds there were grounds for optimism.     But it called on the goverment to continue fostering domestic producers through the Import Parity Price scheme.     \"It makes no sense to abandon this policy now when exploration is at its lowest level for many years and when Australia\\'s oil self-sufficency is expected to decline rapidly,\" Massy-Green said.

              "  'BODY': 'Canadian Trade Minister Pat Carney said that agricultural policies should not hurt world international trade and should therefore become more price responsive over time.     She told delegates at the informal meeting of trade ministers that this was one of five principles Canada wanted adopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Secondly, support for agriculture should avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countries should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that distorted world prices, Carney said.     Carney said the fourth principle was that countries should not introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing legislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must be implemented collectively.     Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines are basically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals announced in Davos, Switzerland, in January.     European trade sources said the conference welcomed the Canadian initiative but some delegates, and not only the European Community, voiced reservations about some of the principles.     Carney said there was a lot of political will among the ministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under four years and that there is also a realisation that it has to be done in a balanced way.     \"The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a broad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early conclusion,\" she said.     However, the meeting did not identify what those areas are, Carney said.  She said Canada/U.S. Bilateral trade negotiations, which must be concluded at least in draft form by October, are progressing well.  REUTER '},\n",

Concepcion told Reuters in an interview that the informal General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) meeting gave ministers from more than 20 nations the chance to examine issues with which GATT did not have the political will to deal.     \"Also, the role of the developing countries has been emphasised in this particular meeting. Somehow it has been the perception of developing countries that GATT is a club of rich countries,\" he added in an interview with Reuters.     \"In fact many of the issues that have been tabled for discussion (in the Uruguay round of trade negotiations) will be of more benefit to the developed countries,\" he said.     Concepcion said at the start of the Taupo meeting that the Uruguay round was meant to be a \"shining act of faith\" in the world trade system.     Concepcion said the Philippines would address the issues of trade in tropical fruit and the improvement of GATT machinery to make it more responsive.     He said tropical fruit came from developing countries but faced non-tariff barriers, quantitative restrictions or very high duties in other nations. Concepcion named Japan and South Korea as examples.

The financing will be for seven years, with four years grace, and will allow the borrower to make drawings in U.S. Dollars. The credit will be transferable and carry interest at 1-1/8 pct over the London Interbank Offered Rate. There is a commitment fee of 1/2 pct.     Banks are being invited to join at four mln stg for 50 basis points and at 2.5 mln stg for 40 basis points.     The terms represent an improvement over those obtained last year, when Barbados tapped the market for a 25 mln dlr transferable loan facility, which carried the same maturity but had interest at 1-1/4 pct over Libor. The facility was subsequently increased to 40 mln dlrs.     However, the loan was not signed until November 5, and bankers said that this year Barbados wanted to have the financing in place early to give it greater flexibility in drawing the funds over the course of the year.     Last year Barbados boosted its capital market borrowings with a small private yen placement in the Japanese market.     At the signing of the 40 mln dlr facility, Winston Cox, advisor to the Central Bank of Barbados, said he was looking to make greater use of the international capital markets to reduce the country's dependence on multi-national orgainsations.     However, bankers believe this will be the country's only major financing for this year, although another small private placement in Japan could be arranged later in the year.  REUTER \"},\n",

In the CBI's February survey, 37 pct of companies expected a rise in output while 54 pct forecast production would remain at present levels and eight pct expected production to drop.     The survey also showed that 23 pct of the polled companies consider current order books to be above normal while 58 pct view them as normal and only 19 pct regard them as below normal.     This was the highest positive balance since the question was first asked more than 10 years ago, the CBI said.     In February, the figures were 24 pct, 22 pct and 54 pct respectively.     Companies also rated their export possibilities higher. Of all polled companies, 23 pct rated their export order books to be above normal and 53 pct described them as normal while only 23 pct believed export orders were below normal levels.     In February, 25 pct thought their export books were below normal and 50 pct believed them to be about normal. At 23 pct, the proportion of companies rating their export books above normal was unchanged between February and March.     On prices, the survey showed that 62 pct of companies expect average prices at which domestic orders are booked will remain unchanged in the coming four months, up from 57 pct in February.

              "  'BODY': 'U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said trade ministers meeting here have reached a general consensus on agricultural trade reform under the latest Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).     Yeutter gave no precise details of the understanding but told journalists the consensus covers the principles involved in agricultural trade reform and what needs to be done to improve the global situation in agriculture.     Delegates from 22 countries are meeting informally to discuss progress made since the latest GATT round was launched in Punta del Este, Uruguay, last September.     Yeutter said \"at least people seem to be going down the same road...But how that translates ultimately into negotiations is another matter entirely.\"     There seems to be an understanding of the need to deal with the problem quickly and \"a more common understanding of how we are going to get from here to there,\" Yeutter said.     However, the hard work is still to come, with a couple of years of tough negotiations ahead, he said.     \"It is ludicrous for the nations of the world to plough immense amounts of financial resources into the production of items that nobody wants to buy,\" he said.     He said the long-term answer is to switch some of the financial resources now committed to agriculture to other more productive areas. This would help agriculture because some its inefficient non-productive segments would stop operating, he said.     Individual segments in many countries may lose in the process, but it should result in a more rational system of world-wide production within 10 or 15 years, he said.     It is important that the agriculture negotiations reach a relatively early conclusion because the U.S. Is spending 26 billion dlrs a year and the European Community probably more than that, which is an ineffective use of financial resources, he said.     Asked about the prospect of a priority for agriculture in the negotiations, he said \"one has to be politically realistic... If there is any chance of getting it (agricultural trade reform) done in two to three years it\\'s going to have to be as part of a larger package.\"  REUTER '},\n",

              "  'BODY': \"Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone intervened to try to resolve Japan's escalating dispute with the U.S. Over semiconductor trade, government officials said.     At today's Cabinet meeting, Nakasone told Trade and Industry Minister Hajime Tamura to redouble his efforts to calm U.S. Anger over what it sees as Japan's unfair trade practices in semiconductors.     Nakasone intervened only two days before a scheduled meeting of the Reagan administration's Economic Policy Council to consider whether Japan is reneging on its microchip pact with the U.S.     That pact, agreed last year after months of negotiations, calls on Japan to stop selling cut-price chips in world markets and to raise its imports of U.S. Semiconductors.     Senior U.S. Officials have accused Tokyo of failing to live up to the accord and have threatened retaliatory action.     Yesterday, Tamura's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) launched a last-ditch attempt to salvage the pact by writing letters to U.S. Policy makers setting out Japan's case and telling Japanese chip makers to cut output.     In his letter, the contents of which were released today, Tamura said a MITI survey carried out at the beginning of March showed Japanese producers were not selling at cut-rate prices in Asian markets.     In a separate letter sent to senior U.S. Officials, MITI vice minister for international affairs Makoto Kuroda suggested the two countries could conduct a joint investigation into allegations of Japanese chip dumping in such markets.

              "  'BODY': 'The dollar is expected to decline further in coming days as scepticism mounts about the effectiveness of last month\\'s Paris accord to stabilise currency exchange rates, senior foreign exchange dealers said.     Following its fall today to a record 148.40 yen, dealers said they expect the dollar to establish a new trading range of 147 to 150 yen before the market again tries to push it down. Behind the latest dollar fall lies the belief that last month\\'s accord was no longer enough to stop operators pushing the dollar down, the dealers said.     \"The recent remark by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker that the Paris accord did not set any target ranges for major currencies has cast a shadow on the agreement,\" said Koji Kidokoro, general manager of Mitsui Bank Ltd\\'s treasury division.     He said the market interpreted this as indicating the U.S. Would favour a weaker dollar and it had little intention of intervening to support the currency.     \"This eliminated the widespread market caution against possible joint central bank intervention,\" Kidokoro said.     Dealers said the dollar had gathered renewed downward momentum and that Bank of Japan intervention alone could hardly contain a further slide in the currency.     They said the central bank bought between one to 1.5 billion dlrs today, including direct purchases through brokers, and yesterday it might have bought a small amount of dollars through the U.S. Central bank in New York.     Most dealers said they doubted the U.S. Federal Reserve would intervene on its own account to support the dollar, but some said this might occur if the dollar fell much below 148 yen.     \"If the dollar drops to that low level, it could reduce the flow of foreign capital into U.S. Securities, which the Americans don\\'t want,\" said Haruya Uehara, chief money market manager of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corp.     He said the dollar may return to around 152 yen next month when corporations reduce their dollar sales after they close their books for the 1986/87 business year ending on March 31.     But dealers said the longer-term outlook for the dollar remained bearish. This was due to the lacklustre performance of the U.S. Economy, the continuing U.S. Trade deficit and Japanese delays in announcing an economic stimulation package.     \"The Americans are getting frustrated at Japan\\'s inertia in stimulating its economy,\" said Hirozumi Tanaka, assistant general manager of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd\\'s international treasury division.     In the Paris currency accord Japan promised a package of economic measures, after the fiscal 1987 budget was passed, to boost domestic demand, increase imports, and thus reduce its trade surplus. The package was expected in April, but debate on the budget has been delayed by an opposition boycott of parliamentary business over the proposed introduction of a sales tax.     In the circumstances the government had only a slim chance of producing a meaningful economic package in the near future, Dai-Ichi Kangyo\\'s Tanaka said.     Dealers said if steps are not taken to stimulate the Japanese economy protectionist sentiment in the U.S. Congress would grow and put more downward pressure on the dollar.  REUTER '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'Nippon Life Insurance Co\\'s 538 mln dlr purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers are likely to follow, securities analysts said.     The investment in one of Wall Street\\'s top brokerage houses is likely to pay off in dollars and international market position, they said. \"It\\'s part of a trend towards growing capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign financial institutions,\" said Simon Smithson, an analyst with Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.     The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.     Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.     The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50 joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset management, market research, and consulting on financing.     Nippon Life is Japan\\'s largest insurance company and the world\\'s biggest institutional investor, analysts said.     The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.     The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese insurers\\' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year. Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and instruments.     Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co\\'s board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.     Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and problem-plagued banks in 1984. \"But now Japanese are going for blue-chip organisations,\" he said.     \"It\\'s a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing industries,\" said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. \"With a historically high yen, and historically low interest rates, there\\'s an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan.\"     Competition in fund management has grown along with greater Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17 to 18 pct, he said.     To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to spread to Japan with further deregulation. \"The high regulatory environment has delayed (life insurance firms\\') diversification. Now there\\'s a growing number of new products in an environment of increasing competition for performance on fund management,\" Smithson said.  REUTER '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'Canadian Trade Minister Pat Carney said that agricultural policies should not hurt world international trade and should therefore become more price responsive over time.     She told delegates at the informal meeting of trade ministers that this was one of five principles Canada wanted adopted in reforming agriculture in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). Secondly, support for agriculture should avoid production incentives, and thirdly, countries should freeze and seek to reduce government aid measures that distorted world prices, Carney said.     Carney said the fourth principle was that countries should not introduce new import barriers not mandated by existing legislation and the fifth was that these basic principles must be implemented collectively.     Carney later told Reuters the Canadian guidelines are basically compatible with the seven point Australian proposals announced in Davos, Switzerland, in January.     European trade sources said the conference welcomed the Canadian initiative but some delegates, and not only the European Community, voiced reservations about some of the principles.     Carney said there was a lot of political will among the ministers here to complete the Uruguay Round of GATT in under four years and that there is also a realisation that it has to be done in a balanced way.     \"The consensus view was to proceed as fast as we can on a broad front and see what areas emerge where we can get early conclusion,\" she said.     However, the meeting did not identify what those areas are, Carney said.  She said Canada/U.S. Bilateral trade negotiations, which must be concluded at least in draft form by October, are progressing well.  REUTER '},\n",

The sources said Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin made the proposal to a 12-bank advisory committee, chaired by Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co as the talks entered their fourth week in New York.     They said the Philippines was now willing to pay a spread of 7/8 percentage points over London Interbank Offered Rates (Libor), up from the 5/8 points it originally proposed.     The sources said the proposal was made in a bid to break a deadlock with the banks, who were insisting on a minimum interest spread of one full percentage point over Libor.     They noted that the latest plan marked a compromise between the two sides\\' demands, but fell short of Ongpin\\'s assertion that the Philippines would insist on a deal better than the 13/16 percentage points offered to Mexico last year by its creditor banks.     The sources added that two key members of the negotiating team returned to Manila last night, indicating agreement was likely to be hammered out by this weekend.

But a bottoming out of the economy depends largely on the yen\\'s exchange rate trend in the immediate future, Agency officials said.     The officials told reporters industrial production, down 0.5 pct in January from December, is likely to turn positive in February and to rise thereafter, raising hopes for a brighter economic outlook.     The Agency predicted industrial production will grow 2.5 pct in the current January/March quarter after falling 0.7 pct in the previous quarter.     A rise of this size would be the largest since the fourth quarter of 1984 when industrial output rose 2.7 pct, the officials said.     They also said an expected upturn in exports would be a mixed blessing as it would contribute to economic growth but would increase the chance of trade friction.     Japanese exports contracted five pct in February from January but are likely to grow from March if the yen stabilizes around current levels, the officials said.

Reagan administration officials said later that Washington did not seek military confrontation with Tehran, but would not let Iran use Chinese-made \"Silkworm\" anti-ship missiles, capable of covering the narrow entrance to the Gulf, to choke oil shipments to the West.     Defence officials said Kuwait had asked if protection for up to a dozen vessels, most of them tankers, could be provided by three U.S. Navy destroyers and two frigates now in the southern Gulf and the Gulf of Oman.     In addition to a half dozen ships in the U.S. Navy\\'s small Mideast Task Force near the Straits of Hormuz, the Pentagon has moved 18 warships, including the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk, into the northern Arabian Sea in the past month.     White House and defence officials said that massing the fleet was routine and had nothing to do with the Iran-Iraq war or Iran\\'s stationing of missiles near the mouth of the Gulf.     The State Department said on Friday that Iran has been told about U.S. Concern over the threat to oil shipments in the Gulf.

Banks, which bid for a total 8.6 billion marks liquidity, will be credited with the funds allocated tomorrow and must buy back securities pledged on April 22.

The call money declines surprised some dealers, who speculated it was because the Bundesbank disbursed further government funds today. However, most said this had not occurred.

We know that we have to reestablish growth at three pct a year to solve the enormous problems confronting us -- and I am referring mainly to unemployment,\" Perigot added.

Sumita said the Bank will take adequate measures including market intervention, if necessary, in line with the February 22 Paris agreement by six major industrial nations.     Canada, Britain, France, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany agreed to cooperate in stabilising exchange rates around current levels. Sumita\\'s statement was issued after the dollar slipped below 150 yen to hit a record low of 148.40.     \"It is inevitable that exchange rates fluctuate under the system of floating rates,\" Sumita said.     The fact the dollar plunged below 150 yen does not mean anything significant under the floating system, he said.     The six nations agreed in Paris exchange rates prevailing then were broadly consistent with underlying economic fundamentals and further substantial rate shifts could damage growth and adjustment prospects in their countries, the Paris statement said.

              "  'BODY': 'The sharp drop in the value of the dollar against the yen and the mark is the first serious test of last month\\'s Group of Five (G-5) plus Canada agreement to stabilise currencies, dealers and bank economists said.     \"The dollar will be pushed down until there is coordinated central bank intervention,\" one dealer for a German bank said, echoing widepread sentiment in the market.     But opinion was divided on whether the united front forged in Paris still exists. Some dealers said there were growing signs the United States wanted the dollar to fall further.     Despite repeated Bank of Japan intervention, the dollar plunged to a post-war low in Tokyo today. It was quoted as low as 148.40 yen in the Far East and dealers here said they expected the U.S. Currency to decline further.     \"The dollar is now firmly within a broad 140 to 150 yen range,\" Chase Bank AG\\'s senior dealer Eckhart Hager said.     Others said there were technical reasons for the sharp dollar drop. \"Window-dressing\" operations by some Japanese companies who were selling dollars and buying yen before the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31 were undermining the U.S. Currency.     Dealers said main reason for the sell-off was not technical. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker\\'s comment the Paris accord did not have fixed dollar targets was seen as a renewed attempt by the U.S. Administration to talk the dollar down.     \"Suddenly, support levels which had existed for fear of central bank intervention disappeared,\" one dealer said.     The Bank of Japan was believed to have bought some 1.5 billion dlrs, and this with comments by Japanese officials indicated Tokyo was unhappy about the plunge, dealers said. Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita threatened central bank intervention if necessary.     Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said today the time had come for the six nations who agreed in Paris last month to stabilise currencies - Japan, Britain, Canada, France, the U.S. And West Germany - to take action in line with the pact.     But the Bundesbank and other European central banks were not detected in the open market during the European morning. Opinion here was divided on when the Bundesbank would act.     While some said the West German central bank would support the dollar once it fell below 1.80 marks, others said the Bundesbank would only intervene after a fall below 1.75 marks or if the decline accelerated.     The Bundesbank last intervened on January 27, when the dollar threatened to fall below 1.81 marks.     \"The Japanese seem to be on their own at the moment,\" one dealer said. Others said cooperation between central banks and governments was easier said than done.     Some said Baker\\'s remarks and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter\\'s warning that the U.S. And Japan were on the verge of a serious trade conflict showed there was a rift.     \"It\\'s hard to tell whether the G-6 agreement still stands,\" a dealer said. Another added, \"If the Americans do not get what they want, they will push the dollar down, regardless of G-6.\"     Citibank AG also cast doubt on the chances of success for the Paris agreement in its latest investment letter.     \"It is hard to see that Japan and Germany are willing or able to loosen fiscal policy sufficiently to offset the necessary U.S. Fiscal contraction,\" Citibank said.     It added, \"Markets should therefore be aware that 1.80 marks is not the lower limit for the dollar -- a rate of 1.70 marks or even less is expected this year.\"     And London Broker Hoare Govett said in its March 1987 economic report, \"We are looking for a further, more gradual, fall, possibly to 1.60 marks by the end of the year.\"     But opinion about whether the Paris accord was still in force was not universal. Some dealers said not too much should be read into Baker\\'s and Yeutter\\'s comments.     \"There is no reason to believe the Paris pact has broken down,\" a senior dealer said.  REUTER '},\n",

Money supply rose at an annualised rate of 16.7 pct last month against 8.1 pct in January. Growth was 11.4 pct in 1986.     A leading Spanish broker said the central bank was applying a more restrictive policy to keep the lid on inflation.     The consumer price index rose 8.3 pct last year.     \"Money supply control is the government\\'s chief weapon against inflation,\" he said. \"The problem is higher rates are attracting liquidity from abroad.\"     He said this was why the central bank enacted specific measures to control the inflow of foreign capital.

Yeutter, in New Zealand for informal GATT ministerial talks, told Reuters bilateral trade disputes are increasing because the multilateral system is inefficient.     \"That is really a strong rationale why we need a new GATT round,\" he said. \"The very existence of all these bilateral irritants clearly emphasises the need to develop multilateral solutions to some of these problems.\"     The eighth GATT round of negotiations was launched at Punta del Este in Uruguay in September 1986. Agriculture and services were included in the negotiations for the first time.     The growing debt burden of Latin American and African nations will also provide impetus for the GATT round to succeed, he said. \"Clearly those countries need to develop their export endeavours and they need open markets for that to happen and that\\'s the basic objective of the new GATT round.\"     But he said the GATT round is a long term endeavour. It will not give any short term relief for debt ridden countries, but it will make a difference in 10 to 15 years.     \"It\\'s a worthwhile activity from their standpoint because these debts are not going to go away in the next year or two,\" he said.     \"They ought to be very strongly supported in the GATT round as a mechanism for relieving their debt burdens or making possible debt amortisation in the future,\" he said.

              "  'BODY': 'The U.S. economy is showing some promising signs of accelerated expansion despite the sluggishness of the fourth quarter last year, private economists say.     Some of the slowness experienced in the October-December period had been expected to spill over into the first quarter this year, as the tax law changes that went into effect in January slowed business and consumer spending.     But some of the latest economic data show signs of surprising strength in the U.S. economy, although some economists remain cautious about the outlook.     The Commerce Department reported today that new orders for durable goods in February jumped by 5.7 billion dlrs, a six pct rise, to 101.2 billion dlrs. Even excluding volatile defense goods, durable goods orders rose a healthy 3.8 pct, the agency said.     The February numbers surpassed the expectations of many financial analysts, whose predictions ranged from flat to increases of up to five pct.     The January/February employment statistics suggest the Gross National Product will show a healthy rate of growth for the first three months of this year, said Lyle Gramley, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association.     The U.S. jobless rate in February and January was 6.7 pct, the lowest rate since March 1980. The number of new non-farm jobs rose by 337,000 in February after a 319,000 gain in January and a 225,000 December increase, the government said.     The employment data suggests a GNP annual growth rate of about three to 3.25 pct in the first quarter, said Gramley.     Much of that will be attributed to businesses rebuilding their inventories and is not likely to be sustained in the second quarter, Gramley said. He expects a slowdown in the second quarter with smaller increases in personal consumption and government spending. He also sees residential construction declining mostly for multi-family housing units.     Fidelity Bank senior economist Mickey Levy said some of the fourth quarter slowness will continue.     Levy predicts GNP will grow at a scant 1.5 pct rate in the first quarter of 1987, accelerate during the second quarter and show a brisk 4.5 pct annual rate in the third quarter.     The key to both forecasts is a marked improvement in the U.S. trade balance which is expected because of the decline in the dollar\\'s value over the last year and half.     \"The improvement will be gradual and long lasting,\" Levy predicted. Most of it will be through import reduction, but at least one-third will be due to a rise in product exports as the prices of U.S. goods become more attractive overseas.     The Reagan administration has predicted the trade deficit, which soared to record levels last year, will improve this year and the U.S. economy will grow by a respectable 3.2 pct for the year compared with a 2.5 pct rate last year.     As part of the effort to reduce the trade deficit, the U.S. has been pressing West Germany and Japan to stimulate their domestic demand for goods from the U.S. and others.     U.S. officials believe that would help take some of the pressure off the United States whose five years of economic growth has been the mainstay of developing countries.     The U.S. economy provided them with a giant market for their goods giving them a way to earn income badly needed to service their foreign debt.     The government last week said the U.S. economy grew at a modest 1.1 pct annual rate during the fourth quarter.     There were indications of improvement in the huge imbalance between the volume of goods imported to the United States and those shipped abroad. The report showed a rising volume of exports corresponding to a decline in imports despite the fact that in current dollar terms, the U.S. trade deficit worsened during the closing three months of 1986.     While fourth quarter economic growth was weak, corporate profits jumped a healthy 6.1 pct during the period, the government said. It also reported that inflation, as measured by the GNP price deflator, remained in check, growing a moderate 0.7 pct in the period, the lowest rise in 19 years.     The government also reported that consumer spending, a key element of the five year economic recovery, jumped 1.7 pct in February, after falling two pct in January.     The Federal Reserve Board also reported that the manufacturing sector, which had been one of the weaker elements of the U.S. economy, was showing signs of recovery.     In its latest report on current economic conditions, the Fed said that economic activity in the various regions of the country ranged from uneven or steady to improving. Manufacturing activity showed signs of improvement in most regions except Dallas where orders remained sluggish.     Chase Econometrics Chairman Lawrence Chimerine said the pick up in the U.S. manufacturing sector is largely due to the drop in the dollar\\'s value. He said he does not foresee a major pick up in economic activity, but does not believe the economy will slip into recession either.     He said higher prices on imported products and wage cuts that have helped the manufacturing sector will squeeze consumers purchasing power.     \"That pattern is starting and will continue for a number of years,\" Chimerine said. He sees economic growth hovering around a modest two pct level for the next few years.  Reuter '},\n",

To move towards increased deregulation of the economy,\" Conable told a press conference at the end of a three-day visit to Jakarta.     Conable directly linked further Bank help for Indonesia\\'s hard-pressed balance of payments to further measures by the government to reduce protectionism and increase efficiency.     The World Bank last month granted Indonesia a 300 mln dlr trade adjustment loan. He said further loans would depend on the economic policies Indonesia adopted.     But he said that in meetings with both President Suharto and leading Indonesian ministers he had not called for specific policy changes.     \"The initiative will have to rest with the Indonesian government. We are not here to dictate to them,\" he stated.     Indonesia, the only Asian member of Opec, has been badly hit by last year\\'s slump in oil prices which cut its revenues from crude exports in half.     Conable had what he termed a frank meeting this morning with Suharto.     He voiced support for measures already taken, including September\\'s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah, and efforts to deregulate imports and stimulate exports.     \"The government can rely on the support of the World Bank in a continuing program of adjustment to the economic realities of today\\'s world,\" he said.     The Bank has loaned Indonesia 10.7 billion dlrs over the past 20 years. Lending is now about one billion a year.     The World Bank would probably like to see further dismantling of tarrif barriers and measures to reduce Indonesia\\'s protected monopolies in areas like steel, plastics and cement, western bankers and diplomats said.     The government has already said it will announce further deregulation measures, but has given no timetable. It is also considering selling off loss-making state companies.     Conable said the Bank would try to help Indonesia find funds to cover its share of development projects, which otherwise would have to be scrapped or postponed.

Herrington, speaking to Houston oil executives at a breakfast meeting, said administration debate over his plan for a 27.5 pct annual depletion allowance was \"heavy and strong\" largely because of some fears that the U.S. oil industry could eventually become as dependent on federal subsidies as the agriculture industry.

              "  'BODY': 'Sudan has rejected a demand by the International Monetary Fund for a currency devaluation because such a move would have a negative impact on its economy, the official Sudan News Agency (SUNA) reported.     Finance Minister Beshir Omer, quoted by SUNA, said his government also rejected an IMF demand to lift state subsidies on basic consumer goods.     SUNA, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corporation, said Omer made the remarks after a meeting in Khartoum yesterday with IMF envoy Abdel-Shakour Shaalan.     Sudan, burdened by a foreign debt of 10.6 billion dlrs, is some 500 mln dlrs in arrears to the IMF, which declared it ineligible for fresh loans in February last year.     In February 1985, Sudan announced a 48 pct devaluation of its pound against the dollar, adjusting the official exchange rate to 2.5 pounds to the U.S. Currency.     Since then, it has resisted pressure from main creditors for more currency adjustments, arguing that past devaluations had failed to boost exports but raised local consumer prices. Sudan also has an incentive rate of four pounds to the dollar for foreign visitors and remittances by expatriate workers.     Dealers in Khartoum\\'s thriving black market said the dollar was sold at 5.5 pounds today.     With stringent import regulations and the government increasingly short of foreign currency, black market dollars are used to finance smuggled imports from neighbouring countries, mainly Egypt, Kenya, Ethiopia and Zaire.     Western diplomats in Khartoum say the meetings between IMF and Sudanese government officials do not amount to formal talks, but rather an effort by the IMF to monitor Sudan\\'s economic performance.     The diplomats said Sudan hoped a planned four-year economic recovery program would be acceptable to the IMF as a serious attempt to tackle the country\\'s economic troubles and persuade its Gulf Arab creditors to pay the IMF arrears.     This, they said, could provide Sudan with a clean bill of health from the IMF that it could take to Western government creditors, grouped informally in the so-called Paris Club, to reschedule debt payments.     Twenty-three pct of Sudan\\'s total foreign debt is owed to members of the Paris Club, the diplomats said.     Sudan\\'s Finance Minister said last month the country\\'s IMF representative had told him the fund\\'s executive board was \"very pleased with the 18.5 mln dlrs arrears we have paid in the past couple of months.\"     The representative, Omer Said, said IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said he would ask Saudi Arabia, to which Sudan owes about 1.4 billion dlrs, to help Khartoum to pay more.     Sudan has an annual debt liability of nearly 900 mln dlrs but set aside only some 200 mln dlrs to service debts in the fiscal year ending next June 30.  REUTER '},\n",

In the quarter ended March 8, the group had a modest sales increase and major improvement in operating performance compared to the year-ago quarter, the company said.     But results softened from the prior quarter because of low bookings last fall for third quarter shipment and holiday shutdowns, it said.

Almost 60,000 tonnes of food was taken out of EC stores between January 20, when Agriculture Ministers approved the scheme, and March 13, according to latest commission figures.     The food, including 30,000 tonnes of cereals, 6,000 tonnes of sugar, 4,000 tonnes of beef and 13,300 tonnes of butter, has been distributed to the needy through charities.     The present scheme was approved as an emergency measure to help poor people affected by this year's unusually cold winter and will end on March 31.     But the spokesman said the commission will consider whether to propose it be replaced by an all-year-round system.     The commission estimates that up to March 13 the temporary scheme cost between 63 and 68 mln European currency units (72/78 mln dlrs). This is above the 50 mln Ecu (57 mln dlr) ceiling originally envisaged by the Ministers.     However, commission sources said the real cost was small if account is taken of the expense of keeping food in store until its quality and value deteriorates.     On the other hand, the impact of the temporary scheme on EC food surpluses has been slight. EC surplus food stocks at January 31 included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter, 520,000 tonnes of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals.  Reuter \"},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'A unanimous Supreme Court ruled that oil and gas exploration can proceed on two tracts off the Alaska coast which were leased by the federal government to eight major oil companies.     The ruling was an important victory for the oil companies and the Reagan administration\\'s controversial off-shore leasing program and a setback for two small Alaskan villages that challenged the leases by claiming damage to the environment.     The administration said that the court-ordered halt in drilling had created uncertainty over the 4.2 billion dlrs paid for 621 leases off the shores of Alaska since December 1980.     A federal appeals court ordered the oil companies to halt all exploration and remove all drilling rigs from two tracts in the Bering Sea off Alaska because of possible harm to the subsistence needs and culture of native Eskimos.     But the Supreme Court said the appeals court was wrong in issuing an injunction halting exploration.     \"Here, injury to subsistence resources from exploration was not at all probable,\" Justice Byron White wrote for the court. \"And on the other side of the balance of harms was the fact that the oil companies had committed approximately 70 mln dlrs to exploration to be conducted during the summer of 1985 which they would have lost without chance of recovery had exploration been enjoined,\" he said.     The oil companies, Amoco Corp <AN>, ARCO, Exxon Corp <XON>, Mobil Corp <MOB>, Sohio, Shell, Texaco Inc <TX> and Union Oil, had said that voiding previously granted leases would result in staggering financial losses.     The first lease sale in 1983 involved 2.4 mln acres and generated 318 mln dlrs while the second lease sale in 1984 covered 37 mln acres and produced 516 mln dlrs.     Administration officials, saying the lease sales were preceded by an intense environmental impact study, denied that the oil and gas exploration would hurt subsistence resources.     The Alaskan villages of Gambell and Stebbins, along with an organization of Eskimo natives on the Yukon Delta, argued that the drilling would hurt native hunting and fishing.  Reuter '},\n",

There will be an immediate repayment of three pct to all the banks, to be followed by various payments at six-month intervals over the life of the agreement totalling some 1.5 billion dlrs.     The three pct payment will be due July 15, 1987.

But he told a press conference that due to the high marginal tax rate on North Sea operations, the main impact of the drop in profit was absorbed by a fall in taxation to 330 mln stg from 1.45 billion in 1985.     The bulk of tax last year was Corporation Tax, with Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT) representing only 16 mln stg, he said.     As a result, post-tax profit from the exploration and production sector fell by only 126 mln stg to 539 mln.     Earlier, Shell U.K., a subsidiary of Royal Dutch/Shell Group <RD.AS>, reported an overall net profit of 757 mln stg, up from 667 mln in 1985, on sales of 6.57 billion stg against 8.81 mln.     Shell U.K. Chairman Bob Reid said the company\\'s crude oil output from the North Sea was at a record 373,000 bpd in 1986, which would almost certainly prove to be a peak for the company. Shell expects a fall in output of around 10 pct in the current year to around 340,000 bpd, due mainly to the decline in output from the major Brent field, he said.     Gas output of 5.9 billion cubic metres and natural gas liquids output of around one mln tonnes in 1986 are expected to be maintained in 1987, he said.     A final decision on development of the Kittiwake and Osprey North Sea oil fields will be made in the next 12 to 18 months, Reid said. The Kittiwake field, originally part of the 2.5 billion stg Gannet project abandoned last year when the oil price fell, is now estimated to cost around 350 mln stg.     Economies on development costs for the Tern and Eider North Sea fields, which were approved last year, have brought the cost down to 30 to 35 pct below the original budget.     Day to day operating costs of the exploration and production sector had been cut 10 pct last year, and the target is to keep costs per barrel constant.     The company drilled 17 wells offshore, with 10 leading to the discovery of hydrocarbons, although it is too early to gauge the commercial viability of these discoveries, Reid said.     Restructuring of the downstream oil sector contributed to a profit rise to 187 mln stg in 1986 from 91 mln stg in 1985.     Jaap Klootwijk, managing director of downstream unit <Shell U.K. Oil>, said refining margins in the first quarter of 1987 were a \"bit better than the very bad fourth quarter 1986.\"     In November and December in particular, refining operations had shown negative margins following the fall in crude and oil product prices, he said. He expected margins to continue generally positive over the summer, although they could dip to become negative from time to time, depending on price movements.     A new catalytic cracker at Shell\\'s Stanlow refinery will now come on stream by the end of first quarter 1988, about five months behind schedule, following a crane accident which severely damaged the plant last year, he said.     Profits from the chemicals sector rose to 33 mln stg from 11 mln after the rationalisation of the Carrington chemical site.     Haslam said the Budget announcement on PRT relief, by which companies will be allowed to offset up to 10 pct of qualifying development expenditure on certain future oil fields against PRT, was \"helpful,\" but rather less than had been hoped for.     Reid said his estimate of crude oil prices this year was in the range of 15 to 18 dlrs. If prices went much above that, he would expect some over-production above OPEC\"s official 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling which would tend to bring prices back down.     He said it looked as if the December OPEC pact to restrain output was holding, bringing supply and demand into balance, but the test will come in summer when demand for OPEC oil will fall.

Group Chief Executive Brian Corby told a news conference that despite returning to trading profits, the International division and the Mercantile and General division had not reached satisfactory levels.     But he said he welcomed Mercantile and General trading profits in 1986 and was optimistic about both that and the International division.     The acquisition of the U.S. Life company <Jackson National> had a small effect in 1986 but its full effect would be felt in the 1987 results, Corby said.     The Group also intended to expand the number of its estate agency firms bought last year, and hoped they will comprise between 10 and 15 pct of total company profits in the future.     \"We hope they will be very profitable very shortly. We are looking for profits from the estate agencies themselves as well as the insurance products associated with them,\" Corby said.

The agreement was signed by Nigerian Finance Minister Chu Okongwu and the Export Credits Guarantee Department's (ECGD) chief executive Jack Gill.     The Nigerians will go on to Paris for similar bilateral talks tomorrow with Coface, the French export credit agency.     Today's agreement follows an agreement between Nigeria and the Paris Club of western creditor governments in December to reschedule some 7.5 billion dlrs of official debt.     The Paris Club agreement was for a rescheduling of the 7.5 billion dlrs of medium and long-term debt due between September 1986 and end 1987 over 10 years with five years grace.     But as with all Paris Club pacts, specific interest rates and other details have to be negotiated on a bi-lateral basis with the countries involved. None of the details contained in today's negotiations was immediately available.     The Nigerians are hoping that further bilateral accords can be struck fairly soon as this could encourage official export credit agencies to renew insurance cover for exports to Nigeria.     The ECGD suspended its cover for exports to Nigeria in 1983. Despite the success of the talks over the past two days, govenment sources said there had not been any discussions on new credits.     Nigeria is due to receive 900 mln dlrs in fresh export credits this year from official agencies under a structrual adjustment program drawn up by Nigeria and the World Bank to support a rescheduling of part of the country's 19 billion dlr foreign debt.

They said they expect gasoline inventories to be depleted by about one to four mln barrels.     Analysts were divided on the crude stocks. Some saw stocks unchanged to as much as three mln barrels higher. Others said stocks could be down one to five mln barrels. Crude throughput volumes are expected to be unchanged to slightly higher or lower than the week ended March 13, traders said.     The API recorded a 7.4 mln barrel stockdraw for U.S. distillates in the week ended March 13. Analysts see another  draw reflecting historic seasonal trends.     For the week ended March 13, API reported gasoline stocks down 2.9 mln barrels.     Those expecting a draw of as much as four mln barrels said they are looking for fairly high consumption rates as the spring and summer driving season gets underway this year, because retail prices are still low compared to recent years.     U.S. crude oil stocks were reported down by 4.4 mln barrels for the week ended March 13. Analysts are divided over the outcome for last week because there is uncertainty about whether throughput levels increased or decreased last week.     Some see crude stock levels unchanged to three mln barrels higher, while others think inventories could be as much as five mln barrels below the previous week.     The lower estimates are supported by the belief that crude runs increased and imports fell.     The API reported crude runs 154,000 b/d higher for the week ended March 13. Analysts are calling it unchanged to slightly up or down for the week ended March 20.     Expectations for product stockdraws are already being reflected in firmer prices, traders said. But if draws are at the higher end of the estimated range, they added, the effect will be bullish. Any stockbuild would be a negative factor, they said.

              "  'BODY': 'The move by foreign exchange markets to test the strength of the Paris currency accord has thrown into question the near-term outlook for sterling, until recently one of the main beneficiaries of the agreement, analysts said.     Since the six-nation accord last month, sterling has risen sharply, adding almost five pct on its trade-weighted index.     While the accord effectively stifled dollar/yen and dollar/mark movements, the markets turned their attention to sterling as foreign investors rushed to take advantage of relatively high U.K. Interest rates.     But analysts say the pound has been sidelined by the first tentative test of the Paris accord seen yesterday.     The market now looks set sooner or later to push the dollar down further in a test of the willingness of central banks to intervene. Analysts say if the banks do not intervene effectively, the Paris accord could collapse.     \"On balance, sterling would be a net sufferer if G-6 collapses,\" Phillips and Drew analyst Stephen Lewis said.     He said sterling would lose out as markets turned their attention to capital movements whereas previously they had been restricted to looking only at the interest yield on currencies.     However, although most analysts and foreign exchange dealers were forecasting a brief period of consolidation or even retracement for sterling, none were expecting a very sharp drop in the U.K. Currency.     Sterling remained supported by optimism on the U.K. Political and economic outlook, firmer oil prices and relatively high interest rates, they said.     Bullish sentiment on the U.K. Economic outlook has been running especially high after last week\\'s budget, seen as popular both with the markets and with British voters.     Sterling was also supported by signs of a weakening in the West German and Japanese economies, where growth for 1987 is trailing behind the three pct forecast for the U.K.     Recent opinion polls showing Britain\\'s ruling conservative party ahead of opposition parties in popularity have also supported the pound.     In addition, sterling has so far shrugged off two half-point cuts in U.K. Bank base lending rates in less than two weeks. A further half-point cut, widely expected in the next week or so, has already been largely discounted.     U.K. Base rates, now running at 10 pct, are still relatively high compared to other western countries, and analysts said a further base rate cut to 9-1/2 pct was unlikely to affect sterling.     Sterling today appeared resilient to the dollar\\'s decline, dropping only slightly on a cross-rate basis.     Worries about renewed turbulence in the foreign exchange markets, however, were reflected in the U.K. Government bond (gilt) market, where prices dropped by up to 5/16 point.     Until now foreign investor interest in the gilt market has been one of the major reasons behind the rise in sterling.     Dealers said they expected the pound to hold quietly steady for the next few days while the market awaits further developments on the dollar and this Thursday\\'s U.K. Current account figures for February.     Market forecasts are for a deficit of around 250 mln stg after January\\'s small surplus.  REUTER '},\n",

President John Bohn told a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing commercial banks have largely withdrawn from financing exports and export projects were becoming smaller.     \"Exporters now need financing in riskier markets and on deals which are smaller, take longer to put together and close,\" Bohn said in his testimony. \"Lenders, however, want less risk, higher profit, transaction-oriented and less labor-intensive activities.     \"It became clear to us the EXimbank must assume a broader range of explicitly defined country and transaction risks than it has previously. Programs and procedures need to be simplified, streamlined and internally consistent,\" he said.     Bohn said the Bank would focus on the needs of the middle market product or service exporter and would have essentially one loan program and one guarantee program for both medium-term and long-term export transactions.     \"Both programs will provide up to 85 pct financing, the maximum permitted under the OECD consensus. Eximbank loans will carry the minimum interest rate allowed by the OECD rate schedule for the market and the term,\" he said.     Bohn said the Bank was requesting a limitation of 1 billion dlrs for regular loan obligations, of which up to 200 mln dlrs may be available as tied aid credits, and a limitation of 10 billion dlrs for guarantee and insurance commitments.

              "  'TITLE': 'SOUTH AFRICA/BANKS AGREE ON DEBT REPAYMENT PLAN',\n",
              "  'BODY': 'South Africa will repay 13 pct of its frozen 13 billion dollar debt to foreign creditors over the next three years under an agreement reached today in London, Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said.     He said South Africa already had repaid five pct of the debt under the standstill agreement expiring on June 30, 1987.    \"These arrangements confirm South Africa\\'s continued willingness to maintain good relations with its foreign creditors and to meet its foreign commitments in a orderly way,\" du Plessis told a news conference.     Du Plessis said the new interim debt agreement was \"substantially a continuation\" of the arrangement ending in June and calls for South Africa to continue paying all interest on its total foreign debt of 23 billion dlrs.     The new debt standstill will extend from July 1, 1987, to June 30, 1990, with a three pct down payment permitted on July 15, 1987, \"provided such debt has already reached maturity,\" du Plessis said.     Finance Minister Barend du Plessis told a new conference that 34 banks holding more than 70 pct of the frozen debt agreed to the new arrangement worked out with South African negotiators in London. About 300 other creditor banks also are expected to approve the agreement, he said.     Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said the agreement was a \"good deal\" both for South Africa and the banks and added that the three-year length of the agreement was of \"enormous significance\" to South Africa.     Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said the agreement was a \"good deal\" both for South Africa and the banks.     Besides the 13-billion-dlr frozen debt, South Africa also owes ten billion dlrs of debt that includes a significant amount of medium -term liabilities that will continue to be repaid on normal maturity dates.     The 13 pct to be repaid under the standstill amounts to 1.42 billion dollars.     A total of five pct or 508 mln dlrs will be repaid in the second half of 1987, with 3.5 pct or 400 mln dlrs in calendar 1988, three pct or 346 mln dlrs in calendar 1989 and 1.5 pct or 166 mln dlrs in the first half of 1990.     Du Plessis said 34 banks holding more than 70 pct of the frozen debt agreed to the new arrangement worked out with South African negotiators in London.     About 300 other creditor banks also are expected to approve the agreement, he said.     De Kock, speaking at the same news conference, said the three-year length of the agreement was of \"enormous significance\" to South Africa.     De Kock said South Africa had negotiated from a \"position of basic economic financial strength.\"     \"We were never overborrowed to begin with and we are now underborrowed by all international criteria that I\\'ve ever heard of,\" he said.     Du Plessis said available foreign reserves of the Reserve Bank, which increased by about 800 mln dlrs in the past two months, and a continued current account surplus \"will be sufficient\" to meet terms of the new interim debt agreement.     Du Plessis said the banks were showing much more confidence in the South African economy and country as a whole.     He attributed this to \"restoration of law and order which has greatly reduced not only the extent of unrest but also the intensity of unrest.\"     South Africa has been under a state of emergency since June 1986 because of black political violence that has claimed over 2,400 lives in the past three years.     Du Plessis said no political demands were made by the banks and South Africa was now rapidly returning to very good relations with its foreign creditors.     He said there were encouraging signs that some foreign investors were again \"taking a more realistic view\" of South Africa.     Recent examples were the rise in the financial rand and the sharp increase in foreign exchange reserves.     Of the 13 billion dlr frozen debt, 3.5 billion dlrs was owed by the public sector and 9.5 billion dlrs by private industry, du Plessis said.     The remaining 10 billion dlrs consisted of seven billion dlrs owed by government agencies and three billion dlrs by the private sector.  Reuter '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'Standard Chartered Plc <STCH.L>, faced with a recession in the key Singapore and Malaysian markets and an ongoing depression in the shipping industry, boosted its bad-debt provisions in 1986, chairman Lord Barber said.     Barber said in a statement on the bank\\'s 1986 results that bad and doubtful debt provisions, both general and specific, stood at 545.6 mln stg against 416.6 mln at end-1985.     Bank figures showed the increase was almost exclusively in the specific bad risk provision, which qualifies for U.K. Tax breaks. New specific provisions rose by 111.5 mln stg while 71.2 mln stg were reallocated from the general risk provision.     In all, a 184.2 mln stg charge was made against profits for 1986, compared with a 100.7 mln stg charge in 1985. Total pre-tax profits fell to 254 mln after 268 mln in 1985.     \"The continuing serious recessionary conditions in Singapore and Malaysia and the depressed condition of the shipping industry made it necessary to provide heavily against bad and doubtful debs arising from loans in the Asia Pacific region, on top of the normal level of provisioning,\" Barber said.     He said, \"the decision was also taken to build up loan loss reeserves by making a sizeable increase in the charges for general provisions for commercial and cross border risks.\"     Barber said due to bad-debt provisioning, the Asia Pacific region made \"a negligible contribution to pre-tax profits.\"     He said the profits contribution from the U.K. Businesses was \"well maintained, although the reported result was affected by cross border debt provisioning,\" while Californian subsidiary Union Bank \"showed continued growth.\"     \"Tropical Africa, Middle East and South Asia all turned in excellent performances and the revival in Europe continued,\" he said.     Barber said the group, which succesfully fought off a takeover bid by Lloyds Bank <LLOY.L> last year, strengthened its capital resources during that year to just over three billion stg, while total assets increased to 32.2 billion.     Capital adequacy ratios remained strong, with the primary capital ratio standing at 7.5 pct at end 1986, he said.  Reuter '},\n",

Experts attributed the fall to lower world market prices following the failure to re-introduce international coffee export quotas, but they said Colombia could compensate the drop with higher exports in calendar 1987.     Coffee export revenue for 1986 was 2.33 billion dlrs, according to the bank.     Jorge Cardenas, manager of the National Coffee Growers' Federation, last week estimated the recent drop of 30 cents a lb in coffee prices would mean a net loss revenue of 457 mln dlrs for Colombia.

The group, which includes Audio/Video Affiliates Inc and a unit of Citicorp <CCI>, said it also obtained additional financing commitments, including an increased commitment from Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd.     The conditions that were eliminated are Cyacq's request for non-public information about Cyclops that was previously provided to Dixons Group PLC and Cyacq's being satisified that the information provides an adequate basis for Cyclop's published financial projections.

The writeoffs will cover the costs of plants and equipment involved, as well as expenses connected with the staff cuts.

The company said about 350 jobs will be affected in Columbia, most of which are now performed by contract workers, and about 225 jobs at its Tennessee Eastman Co plant in Kingsport, Tenn.     Kodak said part of the staff reduction will be achieved through an enhanced voluntary separation and retirement plan for employees of Carolina Eastman, Eastman Chemical Products Inc and other Kodak units in Kingsport, except Holsten Defense Corp. Most of the workforce reduction is expected to be completed by April 30.     Kodak said depressed prices and poor financial performance have led to the decision. It said about 50 mln pounds of POY production will be shut down as a result of its exit from the business. All Kodak POY production has been at Carolina Eastman since last year.     The company said annual capacity for production of Kodel polyester staple fiber will be reduced to 400 mln pounds from 500 mln due to lesser demand.     It said it will proceed with a previous decision to phase in a new 100 mln pound staple fiber plant at Carolina Eastman.     Carolina Eastman employs about 1,350 and the Kingsport units affected about 10,800.     The company spokesman later said the charges will be insignificant and will have no impact on earnings estimates.  Reuter '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'With less than a week remaining to enroll in the 1987 feedgrains program, Agriculture Department officials said that final signup will probably exceed last year\\'s level of 85 pct.     Enrollment in USDA\\'s basic acreage reduction program will likely total close to 90 pct, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, ASCS, officials said, with 50 to 70 pct of the enrolling farmers also expected to sign up for the paid land diversion program.     The signup period of the 1987 feedgrains program officially ends at the close of the business day on March 30.     USDA will release its official signup report around April 15, an official said.     USDA personnel in the corn belt states of Iowa, Illinois, and Indiana have been reporting heavy signup activity, an ASCS official told Reuters.     A surge of acitivity is expected during this final week of signup, the official said.     \"A lot of farmers have been dragging their feet because they were anticipating some changes in the program, but that doesn\\'t look very likely now,\" he said.

              "  'TITLE': 'ILLINOIS CO-OP FUTURES DISSOLUTION VOTE SET',\n",
              "  'BODY': 'The shareholders of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co., the futures trading arm of many Midwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years, will vote Wednesday on its possible dissolution.     The directors of the company called a special meeting and recommended its dissolution last month, citing falling volume and increasing costs.     Sources close to the organization told Reuters the pullout of Growmark, Inc., which holds more than 70 pct of the capital stock, led to the call for dissolution.     The possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing houses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regional and local cooperatives that comprise its membership.     Ironically, it was Growmark, at that time a regional farm cooperative with major river terminal elevators, that founded Illinois Cooperative Futures on December 1, 1960.     But Growmark became affiliated last year with Archer Daniels Midland of Decatur, Ill., and markets its grain through a joint subsidiary of the two companies, ADM/Growmark.     With that relationship, Growmark no longer needs to trade futures through the cooperative, said Tom Mulligan, president of the co-op.     Membership in the company, which Mulligan termed a cooperative of cooperatives, has declined from 99 in 1982. A notable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa, which became affiliated with Cargill, Inc.     Illinois Co-op\\'s other members include such regional cooperatives as Indiana Grain, based in Indianapolis, Goldkist, of Atlanta, Ga., Midstates in Toledo, Ohio, Farmland Industries in Kansas City, Mo., Farmers Commodities, Des Moines, and Harvest States in Minneapolis.     Some observors said the demise of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system.     Instead of banding together, the individual cooperatives are forced to go their own ways, said the floor manager of one cash house at the Chicago Board of Trade.     Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm cooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few major commercial companies are growing dominant, he said.     Don Hanes, vice president for communications with the National Council of Farm Cooperatives, said 5,600 cooperatives exist today, down from 6,700 five years ago.     \"The period we\\'ve gone through in the past five years has been quite a crunch,\" he said. \"There\\'s been a lot of consolidation in the marketing co-ops.\"     One problem, he said, is the co-ops sell the grain to the major commercials for export, rather than exporting it themselves, losing potential profits.     But exporting grain requires heavy investments, and the multi-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by Farmers Export Co., a co-op set up to export grains, served \"to make folks gun-shy,\" Hanes said.     Mulligan said he believes the dissolution, if it is approved, is a result of change in the futures industry rather than a change in U.S. agricultural economics.     A grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm \"was a convenience, something that saved us a little bit of money. (Its dissolution) will force us to change our way of doing business.\"     \"We\\'re sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside,\" he said. \"But there are lot of people out there to do business with. There are plenty of capable firms.\"     Steven W. Cavanaugh, vice president for grain marketing with Indiana Grain, said he would prefer to trade futures through a Chicago-based cooperative.     \"In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to individuals, there would be economic savings,\" he said but added, \"The times change and with changing times, come different opinions of what businesses ought to be around.\"     Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had nothing to do with its profitability. \"I would guarantee you that this company is not in trouble. It is a sound, healthy organization.\"     In the year ended February 28, 1986, the Illinois Cooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members\\' equity, or net worth, of 8.3 mln dlrs. The annual report for the most recent year has not been filed.     Under the cooperative system, income from operations is returned as \"patronage refunds\" to the members.     Income and refunds in the past five years have been declining. In the year ended February 28, 1982, the co-op reported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0 mln dlrs. Patronage refunds in the year ended February 28, 1986, totalled 9.5 mln dlrs.     \"You\\'re dealing with substantially lower volume,\" Mulligan said. \"Lower volume translates into higher costs.\"     According to the company\\'s 1986 annual report, Growmark owns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common shares of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co.     Mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital Growmark is entitled to. He said he could not determine the figure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution. Equity is distributed according to each member\\'s trading volume and, as a result, changes from year to year.     However, Mulligan said the company could continue to meet minimum capital requirements to trade futures even if Growmark pulled out.  Reuter '},\n",

For Conrac, the arbitrageur said, 28 dlrs per share seemed like an \"appropriate price.\" Another said \"it\\'s too early to project the outcome.\"     \"The market is speaking for itself and saying the 25 dlr offer is inadequate,\" the second arbitrageur said. But he added it was hard to make a case for Conrac being worth much more than the 29 dlrs where the shares traded today.     He noted the stock recently sold in the high teens and there could be a downward risk of 10 dlrs or more if Conrac is able to thwart Mark IV.     Conrac urged shareholders to take no action while its board studies the offer and confers with advisers. Conrac said it would make a recommendation by April 17.     A third arbitrageur noted Mark IV had been involved in several takeovers previously and has proven itself to be a determined bidder. \"They\\'re not beginners,\" he said.     Another said Conrac might have trouble if it tried to find another buyer. \"It\\'s a hodge-podge of non-related businesses,\" he said. \"There is only a small universe of people who would want to own the company as it\\'s presently structured.\"     Conrac is involved in video displays, computer software, aircraft instruments, telephone answering machines, welding equipment and other products.     \"I\\'m telling retail clients to sell and leave the rest for those who can take the risk,\" said Rudolph Hokanson, analyst at Milwaukee Co.     He called the 25-dlr offer by Mark IV \"fair value but on the low side.\" \"I don\\'t think management was looking for a buyer in any way before this offer,\" he said.     Hokanson said Conrac has conservative finances and has developed a reputation for quality products that serve niche markets.

Wainoco said it had filed a registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the offering of the two mln units consisting of two shares of common stock and one warrrant per unit for a total of four mln shares of common stock and two mln warrants.     Included in the two mln units to be offered are 280,000 shares of common stock to be sold by <Waverly Oil Co>,  a selling shareholder of Wainoco, it said.     Proceeds of the offering will be used to reduce bank debt, the company said. It said its outstanding 10-3/4 pct subordinated debentures may be used at face value to pay the exercise price of the warrants.     Wainoco said the offering will be underwritten by  E.F. Hutton and Co Inc, Kidder Peabody and Co Inc, and Smith Barney harris Upham Inc.     Simultaneous with the offering, Wainoco said it intends to redeem its shareholder value rights attached to each common share at 10 cts per right. Wainoco said without redemption of the value rights, the company would not have sufficient authorized and unissued shares of common stock to complete the units offering.     Due to certain covenants under the company\\'s 10-3/4 pct subordinated debentures, the value rights redemption is contingent upon the success of the units offering, it said.     Wainoco\\'s said its shareholders purchase rights distributed to the shareholders in June 1986 are unaffected and remain valid.     It said as a result of the liquidation of its Canadian subsidiary into the parent company, it will be able to offset all of its corporate overhead expenses and some of its debenture interests against Canadian income for tax purposes.     Wainoco said its pool of future Canadian tax deductions has been increased by an amount which should generate savings that will exceed existing deferred income tax liability.     Existing U.S. tax loss carryforward benefits in the U.S. are not materially affected, the company said. It added this will considerably reduce future income taxes in Canada and add to Wainoco\\'s net income and cash flow for a number of years.     John Ashmun, chairman of Wainoco, said \"as a result of this recapitalization, Wainoco will be in a strong financial position.     \"Our net income and cash flow will benefit from lower interest expense, lower Canadian taxes, and the considerable savings achieved over the past few years from cost reductions,\" he said.

              "  'BODY': 'The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) moved closer to an agreement on buffer stock rules, with many delegates saying they expect to reach an accord by Friday.     \"Everyone is convinced the buffer stock rules should be in place by Friday so the buffer stock can be put into operation Monday,\" a consumer delegate said. \"The atmosphere is excellent.\"     Other delegates said the buffer stock might not be operational by Monday but could be in place by around April 1, if the rules are agreed by Friday.     A detailed package on how the buffer stock manager will buy and sell cocoa was presented to a buffer stock working group this afternoon -- a big step toward a \"very interesting stage of negotiations,\" delegates said.     The package, based on negotiating principles informally agreed by delegates, has been forged bit by bit during fortnight-long meetings by ICCO Executive Director Kobena Erbynn and a small group of other delegates.     Producers, the European Community (EC) and consumers are scheduled to consider the paper separately and then jointly tomorrow.     Under the proposal, the buffer stock manager would buy cocoa from origins or the second-hand market on an offer system. He would alert the market via news agencies as to when he wanted to buy cocoa and include shipment details and tonnage desired, delegates said.     The manager would buy cocoa on a competitive basis, rather than choosing the cheapest cocoa as before, giving preference to ICCO member-country exporters. Standard price differentials would be fixed for each origin, similar to golf handicaps, to determine the relative competitiveness of offers of various cocoas from different origins, they said.     The differentials could be reviewed at the request of a member country or recommendation of the buffer stock manager, the delegates said. Revision would be decided by a majority vote of the ICCO council.     Buffer stock purchases from non-ICCO member countries would not be allowed to exceed 10 pct of the total buffer stock, they said.     The purchases would be limited to 5,000 tonnes of cocoa per day and 20,000 tonnes per week, and could be bought in nearby, intermediate and forward positions, they added.     One of the underlying ideas of the rules package is \"transparency,\" meaning virtually all the buffer stock manager\\'s market activities will be public and he will have as little discretion as possible, delegates said.     After the tin market collapse in 1985, when the International Tin Council buffer stock ran out of funds, cocoa delegates are anxious to install safeguards in the cocoa market mechanism, they said.      Earnest debate on the buffer stock proposal is expected to begin late tomorrow, as delegations feel the pressure of the approaching Friday deadline, when the ICCO meeting is due to adjourn, delegates said.     The ICCO failed to agree buffer stock rules in January when the new International Cocoa Agreement came into force. The existing buffer stock of 100,000 tonnes of cocoa was frozen in place with its bank balance of 250 mln dlrs -- both untouchable until rules are agreed.      Though the current semi-annual council meeting is not the last chance for delegates to cement buffer stock rules, producers are keen to get the wheels of the market-stabilizing mechanism turning to stem the decline in world prices, delegates said.

              "  'BODY': 'There is a good chance that the United States and Latin America will agree reforms in the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) as a result of talks yesterday with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker, Mexican Finance Minister Gustavo Petricioli said.     \"This is a complex issue, but I am very optimistic on an agreement, he told reporters during the IADB\\'s annual meeting here.     The U.S., which holds a 34.5 pct stake in the Bank, has proposed lowering the veto power to 35 pct, a move strongly opposed by Latin countries which together hold 54.2 pct.     Petricioli said he saw the basis for a compromise when the issue comes up again during the International Monetary Fund and World Bank interim meetings next month in Washington.     He said Baker had indicated receptivity to Latin America\\'s position during talks yesterday with the so-called \"A\" countries - Brazil, Argentina and Mexico - who stand to suffer a net deficit of IADB funding unless the Bank votes a substantial capital increase.     Proposals are on the table for a seventh replenishment of funds totalling 20 billion dlrs for the period 1987-90, plus 2.9 billion carried over from the sixth replenishment.     But Washington has previously said it would not agree to a nine billion dlr increase in its subscription unless reforms were agreed, a position described today by Nicaragua\\'s Central Bank governor Joaquin Cuadra Chamorro as undemocratic.     Petricioli nevertheless said Baker showed \"flexibility in being prepared to accommodate different proposals\" and promised to look into alternatives.     He said an alternative now being looked at was for new procedures for delaying IADB loan approval, to satisfy U.S. concern that lending is currently too lax, rather than a change in the basic voting structure.     There would accordingly be a two-step procedure whereby it would need just a 35 pct vote to delay loan approval for a year, after which a second review would require a 40 pct blocking vote.     \"Any change in the basic voting structure would require a change in the IADB\\'s charter, and in turn a lengthy process of prior approval by the Congresses of each country,\" Petricioli said. In common with Venezuela, he expressed reservations on the conditions that might be placed as a result of Washington\\'s proposals for increased IADB sectoral lending, but welcomed a bigger role for the Bank in U.S. debt strategy.

              "  'BODY': 'The state oil company Petroeleos de Venezuela ended 1986 with a decrease of 45 pct in income from oil sales even though it surpassed its own export goal by almost 100,000 barrels a day, Minister of Energy and Mines Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said.     Speaking to a news conference following the PDVSA annual assembly, Hernandez said PDVSA\\'s income from oil sales had dropped to 7.2 billion dlrs in 1986, down 45 pct from last year\\'s 13.3 billion.     Fiscal revenue from oil sales, which was estimated at 66 billion bolivares for 1986, totalled 43.5 billion, a drop of 34 pct which Hernandez said \"had a very serious impact on Venezuela.\"     PDVSA\\'s export volume averaged 1.508 mln barrels a day, of which 658,000 bpd were crude oil and 850,000 bpd refined products.     The figure surpassed PDVSA\\'s stated goal of 1.410 mln bpd and the 1985 export volume of 1.371 mln bpd. But it was not enough to cover the losses from a drop in the average price from 25.88 dlrs per barrel in 1985 to 13.90 dlrs last year.     The 13.90 per barrel price for 1986 was 1.01 dlrs higher than the figure originally announced by the Central Bank. Hernandez said the increase had come from a new accounting system which included the results of PDVSA\\'s overseas refining and marketing operations.     Consumption in Venezuela\\'s internal market increased from 323,000 bpd in 1985 to 342,000 bpd last year. However, Hernandez stressed that the government had managed to keep gasoline sales almost constant at 164,000 bpd.     Exploration by PDVSA led to an increase of 675 mln barrels in reserves of light and medium crudes, shifting the balance of Venezuela\\'s reserves away from heavy crude oil. The country\\'s production capacity at year-end 1986 was 2.562 mln bpd, of which 1.420 mln are light and medium crudes, Hernandez said.      Venezuela\\'s total proven reserves as of December 31, 1986 were 55.521 billion barrels, the fourth largest amount in the world, Hernandez said.  Reuter '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'Imperial Oil Ltd, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp <XON>, will focus on maintaining its financial strength and improving near-term earnings performance through operating expense reductions and selective capital spending, the company said in the annual report.     Imperial Oil said it expects to spend about 750 mln dlrs on capital and exploration expenditures in 1987, compared to 648 mln dlrs in 1986 and 1.16 billion dlrs in 1985.     Imperial previously reported 1986 operating net profit fell to 440 mln dlrs or 2.69 dlrs share from 694 mln dlrs or 4.27 dlrs share in the prior year.     Imperial Oil said the attention to earnings results from the desire to pursue longer term growth opportunities should the investment climate improve and the belief that low or volatile crude oil prices could continue during the next several years.     The company also said actions initiated during 1986 to restructure and improve efficiency should continue to show benefits in 1987.     During 1986, the company cut operating, administrative and marketing expenses by 91 mln dlrs and reduced the number of workers by 16 pct to 12,500.     Imperial chairman Arden Haynes said in the annual report that it is too early to determine whether the recent upward movement in international oil prices will be sustained.     \"It is still a time for prudence and caution, and the company\\'s actions will continue to be based on the fundamentals of market supply and demand,\" he said.     Haynes said prospects for the company\\'s petroleum products division are more promising than before, but are still uncertain. Imperial\\'s 1986 petroleum earnings rose to 174 mln dlrs from 102 mln dlrs in 1985.     Haynes said more satisfactory product margins on its petroleum products could result if demand recovers as it has in the United States.     The company\\'s chemicals business outlook is mixed, Haynes said. Prospects for growth in petrochemical sales is good as long as economic growth continues, but future large grain surpluses could dampen fertilizer demand and maintain pressure on prices.     Imperial\\'s chemical business earned 17 mln dlrs in 1986, compared to three mln dlrs in 1985.  Reuter '},\n",

The transaction is expected to be completed by September 30.     CPC said it expects no material gain or loss this year from the transaction. But the effect of the deal on 1987 earnings can be evaluated in full only when the definitive pacts are completed, it said.     The long-term effect of the transaction on CPC's earnings should be positive, it added, as it will allow capital expenditures to be cut back and will reduce corporate and divisional overheads as well as operating expenses in the European business.     The sale is an important part of a restructuring announced in November, CPC said.     Proceeds of the sale will be used to reduce debt incurred in the purchase of the Arnold Foods and Old London specialty baking businesses and the stock repurchase program that was  part of the restructuring.     As of December 31, CPC had bought about 15 mln of its common shares, adjusted for a 2-for-1 split in January, for a total cost of 621.8 mln dlrs, according to its 1986 annual report.     In December, CPC acquired Arnold Foods and Old London for a total of about 170 mln dlrs.     CPC had previously said it wanted to sell the European corn wet milling business and use the proceeds to help reduce debt, including that incurred under the share buyback.     In total, CPC has bought back about 16 mln shares of common stock, adjusted for the split, it said today. In November it authorized a buyback of 20 mln shares, adjusted for the split.     The buyback and the restructuring were triggered in November, after companies controlled by Ronald Perelman, chairman of Revlon Group Inc <REV>, acquired about 7.6 pct of CPC's then outstanding stock.     In 1986, the European corn wet milling business had sales of 914.1 mln dlrs, operating income before overheads of 68.8 mln dlrs and associated headquarters overhead costs of 19.7 mln dlrs, according to CPC's 1986 annual report.

              "  'BODY': 'A new agreement covering the repayment of part of South Africa\\'s foreign debt represents a compromise between that country and its commercial bank creditors following several weeks of intense and difficult negotiations, senior banking sources said.     In Pretoria, Reserve Bank Governor Gerhard De Kock termed the agreement a \"good deal\" for both South Africa and the banks.     But as one senior banker noted, \"It is probably the best we could hope for. We (the banks) wanted more money and they (the South Africans) didn\\'t want to pay.\"     The new agreement will extend for three years the standstill arrangement that has been in place since August 1985 and which was due to expire on June 30.     Depending on the maturity of the various debts, banks will receive on July 15 repayments representing three pct of the arrears and the overdue debt covered by the standstill.     It also will require the repayment over the life of the standstill of another 10 pct of the overdue debt spread over six month invervals and depending on the maturity of the various debts for a total of slightly more than 1.4 billion dlrs.     Last year South Africa repaid about 500 mln dlrs out of the 14 billion dlrs covered by the standstill. At the time, bankers had argued - unsuccessfully - for a larger repayment given the country\\'s trade surplus of 2.5 billion dlrs.     Bankers had hoped that this time they could secure an even larger repayment of around one billion dlrs. Although there had been speculation that the standstill would be extended for three years, many did not believe that a long term pact would be acceptable to U.S. banks. Those banks have taken a hard line in the negotiations because of America\\'s strong anti-apartheid policies.     The agreement reached today differs very little from the one reached a little over a year ago. However, it does include one moderation of an option contained in that pact which introduces yet another \"catchphrase\" into the jargon for reschedulings.     The new agreement contains an \"exit vehicle\" under which banks can convert their debt into 10 year loans. Under the previous agreement banks were only given options for three year loans.     While the option may be unpalatable to the U.S. banks, it could offer others a potential repayment of slightly more than half their investment over the next seven years.     To convert the debts, a bank would have to find a borrower looking for a loan with a 10-year maturity and then negotiate individually the interest rates to be charged.     The loans would not represent any new money and as the loan would be the obligation of the new borrower there would be a repayment stream that could give the bank as much as 52 pct of face value by year seven, one banker said.     Bankers suggested that depending on a banks\\' political and economic forecasts for South Africa, if it decided to take the option it may not have much difficulty finding such borrowers. They noted that South Africa\\'s Public Investment Commission is an active borrower in this area of the market.     Today\\'s agreement was reached between South Africa\\'s chief debt negotiator Chris Stals, who chairs its Standstill Coordinating Commmittee and representatives of the 12 banks on the commercial bank technical committee.     The bankers said that telexes will be sent today to the country\\'s other 330 bank creditors and that documentation covering the proposal will be mailed out shortly.     Because of the banks\\' sensitivity to South Africa\\'s apartheid regime, the previous negotiations were conducted with Fritz Leutwiler, the former head of the Swiss National Bank, acting as mediator.     Leutwiler was not involved with these talks and has not involved himself in the negotiations since last year, the bankers said.     Last time, the banks sent their responses on the proposal to Leutwiler who in turn notified the South Africans. This time the procedure will be less structured and will be up to the individual banks as to how they wish to handle it.     Although talks had been held in recent weeks between the South Africans and the banks, the completion of the agreement on the repayments took many in the financial community by surprise.     A review of South Africa\\'s economy by the technical committee\\'s economic sub-committee was to be held in February while the talks for the rescheduling were due to start some time this month or next month.     However, the bankers said that because of all the publicity which surrounds South African debt negotiations, the meetings were kept secret.  Reuter '},\n",

The Democratic-controlled committee said the administration\\'s export control policies, which restrict shipment of thousands of products, contributed to last year\\'s record 169 billion dlr U.S. trade deficit.     The committee said the legislation will cut government red tape and make it easier for U.S. companies to compete with foreign producers since many of the goods are readily available from other countries.     Rep. Don Bonker, chairman of the International Economic Policy subcommittee, said the unnecessary restrictions had cost the U.S. 17 billion dlrs in exports a year.     \"This is Congress\\' number one opportunity to attack the trade deficit in a positive way by exporting more,\" the Washington Democrat said.     The legislation would order the Commerce Department to lift controls on 40 pct of goods on the restricted export list over the next three years unless other countries agree to comparable controls.     Most of these are of the least sophisticated type of technology such as medical instruments.

              "  'BODY': 'South Africa will repay 13 pct of its frozen 13 billion dollar debt to foreign creditors over the next three years under an agreement reached today in London, Finance Minister Barend du Plessis said.     He said South Africa already had repaid five pct of the debt under the standstill agreement expiring on June 30, 1987.     \"These arrangements confirm South Africa\\'s continued willingness to maintain good relations with its foreign creditors and to meet its foreign commitments in a orderly way,\" du Plessis told a news conference.     Du Plessis said the new interim debt agreement was \"substantially a continuation\" of the arrangement ending in June and calls for South Africa to continue paying all interest on its total foreign debt of over 23 billion dlrs.     Du Plessis said 34 banks holding more than 70 pct of the frozen debt agreed to the new arrangement worked out with South African negotiators in London. About 300 other creditor banks also are expected to approve the agreement, he said.     Reserve Bank governor Gerhard de Kock said the agreement was a \"good deal\" both for South Africa and the banks.     Speaking at the same news conference, de Kock said the three-year length of the agreement was of \"enormous significance\" to South Africa.     He said South Africa had negotiated from a \"position of basic economic financial strength.\"     \"We were never overborrowed to begin with and we are now underborrowed by all international criteria that I\\'ve ever heard of,\" de Kock said.     Du Plessis said available foreign reserves of the Reserve Bank, which increased by about 800 mln dlrs in the past two months, and a continued current account surplus \"will be sufficient\" to meet terms of the new interim debt agreement.     Du Plessis said the banks were showing much more confidence in the South African economy and country as a whole.     He attributed this to \"restoration of law and order which has greatly reduced not only the extent of unrest but also the intensity of unrest.\"     South Africa has been under a state of emergency since June 1986 because of black political violence that has claimed over 2,400 lives in the past three years.     Du Plessis said no political demands were made by the banks and South Africa was now rapidly returning to very good relations with its foreign creditors.     He said there were encouraging signs that some foreign investors were again \"taking a more realistic view\" of South Africa. Recent examples were the rise in the financial rand and the sharp increase in foreign exchange reserves, he said.     Of the 13 billion dlrs frozen debt 3.5 billion was owed by public sector and 9.5 billion by private industry, du Plessis said. The remaining 10 billion consists of seven billion owed by government agencies and three billion by the private sector.  Reuter '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'World Bank President Barber Conable expressed concern that trade protectionism, at the heart of a new showdown between the United States and Japan, might spread throughout the industrial world.     But in an interview with Reuters, Conable said the action by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a full-scale trade war.     Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing countries to open their markets, arguing that a free trading environment increased the possibility of global economic growth.     \"We have, in fact, been making adjustment loans to many countries in the developing world which have encouraged the opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the developed world doesn\\'t close at the same time,\" he said.     He said the U.S. action against Japan was \"a significant retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in trade policy.\"     The interview came just before next week\\'s semi-annual meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund.     Referring to Brazil\\'s recent interest payments moratorium, Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious and must be closely watched.     He said the Bank, which in the past has concentrated on making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the developing world such as dams, roads and sewers, will increasingly make assistance available for economic reform.     The Bank has increased these loans, in part because of the debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms aimed at opening their markets, encouraging foreign investment and reducing government\\'s role in the economy.     \"We\\'re comfortable with adjustment lending, we expect, however, that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio,\" Conable said.     He made clear, however, that adjustment lending would continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending for some time.     He noted, \"the problem of debt was a severe one and many countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the problem of debt.\"     Conable, is a a former Republican Congressman from New York chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year. He is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched the U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October, 1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by the World Bank.     Conable also said that he expected the result of a major study of the Bank\\'s organization to be completed in the next several weeks.     He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based, in part, on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the richest countries because of inefficiency.     the reorganization is considered a major initiative by Conable, and is being closely-watched by the agency\\'s 151 member-countries as an indication of his management style and priorities.     \"I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be permitted to grow,\" Conable said.     However, he said \"I don\\'t believe there is anything basically wrong with this institution and I don\\'t believe it has to have any redefinition of its purpose.\"     He said, however, that it was apparent that the debt initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role in dealing with the debt crisis.     Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its sister agency, the International Monetary Fund, was good and that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus on a variety of issues.     On a personal level, Conable said that he not feel a need to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that \"I don\\'t have a particular mission here except to be useful to the institution and to the process of development.\"     He added, \"so I don\\'t feel a great calling to personalize the institution.\"     On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa, Conable said that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting the region, noting that half of the recently agreed financing of 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank\\'s International Development Association was earmarked for Africa.     Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations, like those in the Sub-Sahara, during next week\\'s meetings.  Reuter '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'A steep drop in goods-producing jobs detracted from U.S. March non-farm payroll employment and makes it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy to defend the dollar, economists said.     U.S. March non-farm payroll employment rose 164,000, less than the gain of 220,000 to 290,000 the financial markets expected. Manufacturing employment fell 25,000, compared with February\\'s 50,000 gain, while March construction employment dropped 45,000 after being unchanged in February.     \"The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we end the first quarter,\" said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc. \"This sets the stage for more sluggish growth in the second and third quarters.\"     \"The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy,\" he said. \"They will not ease as long the dollar is weak, but clearly they can\\'t tighten.\"     David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downward revision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236,000 from 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarter were weaker than expected.     While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S. gross national product growth at 3.5 pct, he said the March jobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quarter growth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct.     Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the average monthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only 237,000, compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986.     \"There\\'s momentum in first quarter labor force activity,  but less than assumed,\" he said. \"Gains in goods-producing jobs were subdued at best. This rules out any possibilty of the Fed tightening for exchange-related purposes.\"     In March, the average workweek fell back to its January level of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in February. Manufacturing hours also fell back to their January level, totalling 40.9 hours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February.     The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturing jobs in March was concentrated in automobile, electrical and  electronic manufacturing.     Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a 13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs.     Economists said that a build-up in auto inventories resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead.     Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in the first-quarter GNP accounts.     Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise two pct, to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1.5 pct at best in the second and third quarters. He said the March drop in industrial activity \"is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate contribution inventory accumulation made to GNP.\"     Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains in industrial production and personal income for March. They expect only marginal gains, if not small declines, for these indicators, compared with a February increases of 0.5 pct in industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income.     Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop in March construction employment may also signal a drop in March housing starts, which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851 million units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units in January.     The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct, its lowest level since March 1980, from 6.7 pct in February. But Wyss pointed out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force, which  fell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February.     \"This just means that there were fewer people looking for work, so the drop in unemployment doesn\\'t mean much,\" he said.     He said the latest employment report will not concern the Fed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of 2.5-3.0 pct, but \"it does suggest they can\\'t afford to tighten to quickly either.\"     The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor force gains, just as seasonal factors probably overstated them in January and February, Slifer said, but are consistent with his forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth.     Economic growth remains sluggish, but Silfer does not think that the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their meeting this week. \"At some point they will be more inclined to ease,\" he said. For the time being, however, the March employment report \"increases the likelihood they won\\'t tighten, regardless of the dollar.\"   Reuter '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'The Securities and Exchange Commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for the shares of companies that they must extend the period their offers are open if key conditions are changed.     Specifically, the agency said those making tender offers for companies\\' stock must extend the offers if they decide to eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be tendered in order for the offers to be valid.     Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions. As a result, a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached.     In an interpretation of current rules, which officials said clarifies the SEC\\'s present position, the agency said a tender offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived, even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so.     The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share condition is a \"material change\" of the tender offer under U.S. securities law, SEC officials said.     The SEC has already said that other specific material changes, such as changes in the percentage of securities being sought or the price being offered, made during the course of a tender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer.     The length of the extension, which is aimed at giving shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender offer, was not specified in cases where the minimum share conditions were waived.     SEC officials said the length of the extension in such cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding each case, but would generally be between five and 10 days.     The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each offer, denying shareholders the chance to react to the new information. Officials declined to identify the two offers.     \"If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of its offer, it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate dissemination,\" the SEC said.     Federal securities law requires that all tender offers remain open for at least 20 business days.  Reuter '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'U.S. scientists said some tropical vegetable oils can be hazardous to consumers whose health is at risk because of high levels of saturated fat, lending weight to a campaign by the American Soybean Association (ASA) for labelling changes.     The scientists appeared to support an ASA charge, denied by Malaysian palm growers, that imported coconut, palm and palm kernel oils contain high levels of saturated fat and thus raise blood cholesterol and the risk of heart disease.     In a petition filed in January, the ASA asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to require palm, palm kernel and coconut oils to be identified as saturated fats on food manufacturers\\' labels.     The FDA responded to the ASA in a letter saying it would consider the petition as a comment to a proposed rule dealing with cholesterol and fatty acid labelling of foods.     Malaysian oil palm growers have said the charges by the ASA that palm oil consumption increases blood cholesterol and contributes to heart disease are untrue.     But Steve Chang, Professor of Food Science at Rutgers University, said, \"Palm oil is definitely not good for human health because it has a high content of saturated fatty acid.\"     He added that the higher the fatty acid, the greater the blood cholesterol level. \"It has been well established that high cholesterol levels will have a higher level of heart disease,\" he said.     A Malaysian Oil Palm Growers Council official, Borge Bek-Nielsen, has said studies have shown that palm oil is cholesterol-free, low in saturated fats, has anti-cancer properties and prevents blood clotting and blocking of arteries in humans.     Bek-Nielsen said Americans consume more saturated fats daily through food like butter, bacon, ham and beef than from palm oil, which, he added is rich in vitamins A and E.     David Kritchevsky, Associate Director of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, appeared to take the ASA view on labelling. \"What people really have to learn is to read labels,\" said Kritchevsky. \"The more a consumer knows, the more likely he will make an intelligent choice.\"     The U.S. scientists said they had no doubt imported palm, palm kernel and coconut oils contain high saturated fat levels.     Kritchevsky, a specialist in nutrition, said, \"More saturated fat would raise cholesterol levels...So, from that point of view it\\'s a health risk. High cholesterol levels in the blood are a risk factor for heart disease.\"     Susanne Harris, deputy assistant secretary of the U.S. Agriculture Department\\'s Food and Consumer Services Division, said the health risk among consumers of vegetable oils with high saturated fat levels was highest among those who have heart disease.     The scientists said more than 50 pct of the fatty acid content of the tropical oils was saturated, whereas less than 20 pct of the fatty acid content of soybean oil was saturated.     David Ericksen, director of ASA\\'s technical services, said U.S. soybean producers could regain about one-half of the 273 mln dlrs in sales lost to imported tropical oils if consumers were aware the vegetable oils were high in saturated fat.     Imported tropical oils displace 171 mln bushels of U.S. soybean sales in the U.S. market, ASA estimates.     U.S. imports of coconut oil during January totaled 82.9 mln lbs compared with 48.0 mln lbs in December and 106.5 mln a year earlier, according to Commerce Department figures.     Imports of palm oil totaled 44.0 mln lbs compared with 51.3 mln lbs in December and 85.2 mln a year earlier.  Reuter '},\n",

Financial statements from Canada\\'s major oil companies, culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd\\'s 2.20 billion Canadian dlr 1986 loss reported this week, painted a bleak picture of last year\\'s results, analysts said.     \"But the financial statements are a snap shot and a recording of history. The stock market is the indication of the future,\" Gobert commented.     The Toronto Stock Exchange\\'s oil and gas index of 41 companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15 at the end of 1986.     Among Canada\\'s largest oil companies, class A shares of Imperial Oil Ltd <IMO.A>, 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp <XON>, is trading at 71, up from a 52-week low of 34-3/4.     Shell Canada Ltd, 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch/Shell Group, is at 40-1/2, up from a low during the last year of 18-3/4. Texaco Canada Inc <TXC>, 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc <TX>, is at 34-7/8, up from a low of 24-1/2.     Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts operating profit for 10 of Canada\\'s largest oil and gas companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion dlrs, based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S. dlrs a barrel. \"However, if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a barrel...1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase with cash flow 27 pct higher,\" analyst Plexman said.     \"Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the profit improvement this year, the gain should be significant,\" he added.     Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986, when operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05 billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90 billion dlrs.     But one industry source doesn\\'t think oil prices will hold recent gains and more government assistance is needed.     Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987, after dipping about 60 pct last year. Maciej said he sees crude oil supply outweighing demand and doesn\\'t believe a recent OPEC production accord will continue to support prices.     However, several companies share the optimistic industry outlook expressed by a majority of analysts.     Shell Canada and <Norcen Energy Resources Ltd> forecast improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this week, assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels.     \"The industry\\'s outlook for 1987 is positive, but not robust,\" Texaco Canada said in its annual report.     \"While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable, continued volatility is likely,\" Texaco Canada added.     In the face of short-term uncertainty, many companies have pared 1987 spending plans from last year\\'s lower levels, deferring most frontier exploration work.     \"The industry is becoming very selective in investments, very conservative and cautious, which is not unexpected,\" Canadian Petroleum Association\\'s Maciej said.     Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results.     The most significant help came last September when the federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax (PGRT) 28 months earlier then planned.     Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988.     The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further exploration spending cuts, analysts said.     \"For a number of companies, the PGRT cut was absolutely necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that were made, otherwise the reduction would have been considerably more,\" Maciej said.

              "  'BODY': 'Rising demand for U.S. rice may gradually reduce surpluses while a marketing loan should help increase the U.S. share of the world rice market despite sluggish trade this year, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its quarterly rice outlook and situation summary, the department said U.S. rice use may surpass production during the 1986/87 marketing year, causing stocks to fall about 10 mln hundredweight from a year earlier to an estimated 67 mln cwt on July 31.     Long grain acreage as a percentage of total acreage is expected to decline this year, the report said.     USDA said factors once supportive of increased long grain acreage have turned around. Domestic prices of medium grain relative to long grain have increased, the loan differential has been greatly reduced and increases in long grain yields relative to those of other classes have leveled off.     With the drop in domestic prices resulting from the marketing loan, domestic rice use is expected to grow at a faster rate, USDA said.     \"Development of new products and increased promotion have helped make rice more available and visible to a wider range of consumers,\" USDA said.     USDA said world trade is expected to fall in 1987 because of large production and stocks but a weaker market should affect competing exporters more than the U.S.     \"The United States has already recovered a substantial share of the European Community market and made inroads into markets in the Middle East and Africa,\" the report said.     World rice consumption is projected to reach record levels in 1986/87, the report said, as higher per capita incomes, increased domestic production and low import prices have allowed people in many countries to substitute rice for coarse grains.     China, India and South Korea have increased output, while the Middle East and Africa have doubled imports since the mid-1970s, the report said.  Reuter '},\n",

The petition, filed by Bob Evans Farms, Odom Sausage Co, Sara Lee Corp and Owens Country Sausage, asks USDA to allow mechanically separated meat to be listed on product labels as the species from which it was derived.     For example, \"pork\" would be listed on the ingredients statement instead of \"mechanically separated pork.\"     Under the petition, the calcium content of the meat product would have to be stated on the label and the mechanically separated meat could constitute no more than 10 pct of the meat and poultry portion of the product.     Mechanically separated meat is a high-protein, low-cost product that has been approved for use since 1978, USDA said.     Current regulations allow use of mechanically separated ingredients at levels up to 20 pct of the meat and poultry product, but require it to be listed in the ingredient statement as \"mechanically separated (species),\" USDA said.     USDA said the petitioning firms claimed companies avoid using mechanically separated meat in their products because the term carries an \"unwarranted negative connotation\" in the minds of many consumers. The petitioners also noted that no similar regulation exists for poultry products.     Mechanically separated meat is made by placing carcass parts, which usually have been hand-trimmed but still have some remaining meat, into specialized processing equipment.  Reuter '},\n",

The FOMC issued an asymmetric inter-meeting policy directive which gave greater possibility to firmer rather than easier policy. The Committee set a six to seven pct January through March annualized growth target for M-2 and M-3 and no M-1 goal. At the prior meeting in mid-December, the FOMC set a seven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March.

No conclusions were contained in the minutes.     In its inter-meeting policy directive, the February FOMC said that \"somewhat greater reserve restraint would, or slightly lesser reserve restraint might, be acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates, taking into account the strength of the business expansion, developments in foreign exchange markets, progress against inflation, and conditions in domestic and international credit markets.\"     The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchanged policy.

He noted the strong growth in bank loans in November through January and the firm federal funds rate that had prevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth. He also cited the recent declines in the dollar\\'s value.     Finally, looking ahead, Melzer pointed out the potential for a further rise in inflationary expectations. He believed that prompt restraints might avert the need for more substantial tightening later.     Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments, the FOMC minutes showed, \"the members generally felt that policy implementation should be especially alert to the potential need for some firming of reserve conditions.\"     In this view, the FOMC said somewhat greater reserve restraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow in line with current expectations and there were concurrent indications of intensifying inflationary pressures against the background of stronger economic data.     One indication of potential price pressure might be a further tendency for the dollar to weaken.     The minutes showed that one member, presumably Melzer, preferred a directive that did not contemplate any easing during the weeks ahead. However, \"most of the members did not want to rule out the possibility of some slight easing during the inter-meeting period, although they did not view the conditions for such a move as likely to emerge.\"     The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in the dollar\\'s value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have any significant effect on the Fed\\'s economic projections. In addition, they anticipated that considerable progress would be made in reducing the federal budget deficit.  Reuter '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'The U.S. Treasury market ended sharply higher, reassured by news that the Federal Open Market Committee voted in February to maintain the then-existing degree of restraint on bank reserves, dealers said.     News of a weaker-than-expected March employment report and a minor bounce back in the dollar prompted short-covering that pushed coupon issues higher, while an easing in the Federal funds rate below six pct helped short-dated issues.     The key 7-1/2 pct 30-year Treasury bond price finished 3/4 higher at 95-27/32, pushing the yield down to 7.86 pct from 7.93 pct yesterday.     Danuta Zielonka of Wertheim Schroder Co Inc said that recent slowing in the growth of the monetary aggregates is a another factor arguing against firmer Fed policy.     \"Money growth has been slowing perceptibly in March which should give them more room to not tighten,\" she said. \"Both M2 and M3 are will be at the low end of their target ranges in March.\"     \"The FOMC minutes are neutral for the bond market,\" Zielonka said. \"Dollar considerations will prevent them from easing anytime soon, but they can\\'t tighten with the economy weak and the banks having to deal with Brazil.\"     Doubts on the economy\\'s strength were underscored not only by a smaller-than-expected 164,000 gain in March non-farm payrolls, but also by a downward revision in February\\'s gain to 236,000 from a previously reported 337,000.     The market\\'s initial reaction to the data was restrained by fears the employment news would undermine the dollar, but when the dollar maintained a firm tone, the bond market extended its gains.     Profit-taking pulled bond prices down from the day\\'s highs, but a record close in the U.S. stock market stimulated buying late in the day that offset this somewhat.     Still, coupon issues were unable to recover completely from this week\\'s steep losses as trade tensions between the U.S. and Japan pressured the dollar and discouraged Japanese investors from buying U.S. Treasury bonds.     The current 7-1/2 pct Treasury bond traded down to 94-11/32 in Tokyo this week, pushing the yield to 7.98 pct. This capped the U.S. 1987 high yield on the 30-year bond of 7.93 pct, seen yesterday.     Treasury bills advanced on the week. The six-month bills rose one basis point, but three-month bills fell 17 basis points and the year bill fell two basis points.     Dealers said that the sharp drop in three-month bills resulted in part from recent outright bill purchases for a customer, believed to be related to heavy intervention by foreign central banks to support the dollar.     A drop in the Fed funds rate to 5-15/16 today underpinned a decline in bill rates. It traded at this level throughout the session, down from yesterday\\'s 6.14 pct average.     Three-month bills closed two basis points lower at 5.48 pct bid. Six- and 12-month bills both dropped nine basis points to respective bids of 5.70 pct and 5.75 pct.  Reuter '},\n",

In the company\\'s newly-released annual report and 10-K filing, Gulf States said its bank lenders had notified the utility last month that no additional credit would be granted. Gulf States said the banks had requested the utility to begin making prepayments by the end of April of 45 mln dlrs more than the estimated 1987 lease payments of 40 mln dlrs.     \"The circumstances increase the likelihood that the company may have to seek protection from its creditors under the bankruptcy code,\" Gulf States said.     The utility had previously said it might be forced to consider filing for bankruptcy because of limited rate increases granted by state regulators in connection with Gulf States\\' 4.3 billion dlr River Bend nuclear plant in Louisiana.     \"If the regulatory commissions approve the company\\'s proposed rate moderation plan and grant the increases provided for in such plan during the initial three-year phase-in period, the company believes it could achieve financial stability,\" Gulf States said.     In February, the Texas Public Utilities Commission granted Gulf States an interim rate increase of 39.9 mln dlrs contingent upon the utility obtaining a new 250 mln dlr line of credit to pay operating expenses. The utility had sought 144.1 mln dlrs in rate hikes in Texas.     Gulf States has appealed a decision by Louisiana state regulators rejecting its application for 100 mln dlrs in emergency rate relief.     In 1986, Gulf States earned 244.9 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.47 billion dlrs, compared to profits of 265.4 mln dlrs on sales of 1.85 billion in the previous year.  Reuter '},\n",

By drawing on its parent company's strength, a weaker finance subsidiary can achieve a credit rating as high as its parent.  An independent finance company on the other hand must operate within more stringent guidelines than a unit and is at a competitive disadvantage, S and P said.      The agency rates a finance unit on its creditworthiness  as well as the support agreement it has with its parent.

The agreement assures that the unit meets its obligations on time and requires it to operate within specific guidelines.

              "  'BODY': 'President Alan Garcia said he sought to deepen Peru\\'s hard-line foreign debt stance, possibly by limiting repayments to the World Bank.     In a televised address tonight, he criticised the World Bank for making Peru make larger debt payments than the amount the bank is willing to make in new loans. \"We will deepen our policy on the foreign debt,\" he said.     Peru has limited foreign debt repayments to 10 pct of export earnings, effectively suspending most remittances due foreign private banks and many governments. It has generally been current for most of Garcia\\'s 20 months in office on payments to the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank.     But tonight Garcia said: \"We have met our aim of limiting the payment of the debt and will limit it also even though organisations like the World Bank have credits which oblige us to buy a certain type of machinery and to build certain types of public works and not others, and to pay much more in dollars than that which they are willing to newly lend us.\"     The Economy Ministry said last year it owed the World Bank about 520 mln dlrs in loans out of the country\\'s 14 billion dlr debt.     Garcia said his government had been a model for Latin America because Peru had enjoyed growth in gross domestic product (GDP) last year of nine pct while taking its hard line on debt. He said GDP would grow by at least six pct this year.     He announced an immediate 40 pct rise in the minimum wage to 1,260 intis per month, benefiting the 1.3 mln minimum-wage workers out of a total labour force of 6.7 mln.     Salaries will go up this month by 30 pct for civil servants and 27 pct for those workers earning above the minimum wage but not covered by collective bargaining agreements.     He also said the price of petrol, frozen since August 1, 1985, would increase by 20 pct from the current 17.5 intis per U.S. Gallon and remain at the new level for the rest of the year. He did not say when this increase would be effective.     Taxes on petrol are the government\\'s leading revenue earner, traditionally accounting for about one-third of taxes. Sales taxes on autos, liquour and cigarettes would also go up, he said, without specifying the amount.     Garcia announced the government would encourage Peruvians to repatriate their savings deposited abroad by paying a 15 pct premium above the market exchange rate.     The inti\\'s official buy-sell rate against the dollar is 14.85/92 and the free rate is about 21.70/80.     To encourage private investment, he said the government would set up a special fund with which it would match every two intis of private investment with one inti from the government.     He also said his dismissal of Peruvian Air Force Commander Lieutenant General Luis Abram Cavarellino yesterday strengthened the democratic authority of his government.  REUTER '},\n",

The UAE quota assigned by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is 902,000 bpd. Traders could buy Abu Dhabi's Umm Shaif crude on the spot market for 17.50 dlrs a barrel yesterday, against the official OPEC price of 17.72 dlrs.     The sources said output by Abu Dhabi, the largest UAE producer, fell to around 700,000 bpd from a range of 800,000-820,000 bpd during the preceding four months.     Dubai production slipped to an average 350,000 bpd from around 370,000 in February after the emirate declared a mid-February output cut to help boost world oil prices, the sources added.     Most of the Abu Dhabi drop came from the offshore Umm Shaif and Upper and Lower Zakum fields as customers found fixed prices too high and cut liftings, the sources said.     The onshore Murban grade was less affected because Japanese term buyers saw strategic benefit in maintaining liftings, they added. The Japanese firms lift around 120,000 bpd, most of it Murban.     Abu Dhabi considers output from Upper Zakum, which came on stream in 1983, to be test production not included in calculations for complying with the OPEC quota.     Without Upper Zakum, the UAE would be producing roughly its quota in March, the sources added.  REUTER \"},\n",

But he added that arguments against joining had weakened.     Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, widely believed to be the strongest government opponent of full EMS membership, has made clear she does not expect to consider joining until after the next UK election, due by mid-1988 at the latest.     But Lawson, in answer to a question, told reporters after an informal European Community finance ministers\\' meeting here that other factors apart from the upcoming election stood in the way of full membership.     In addition to the question of the exchange rates at which Britain should enter the EMS\\'s core exchange rate mechanism, there was also the impact of sterling membership on the system to be considered, he said.     British entry would change the EMS from a monopolar system based on the West German mark to a bipolar mark-sterling system, he noted. \"We have to make sure it would work.\"     But Lawson added that some of the considerations that had made it difficult for Britain to join in the past now posed less of a problem.

              "  'BODY': 'European Community (EC) finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for greater cooperation to strengthen the European Monetary System (EMS) against international market turbulence, officials said.     \"There was a general will to reinforce the European Monetary System, with all that implies,\" Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session of informal talks at this Belgian coastal resort.     The gathering was the first such discussion since the second major realignment of EMS parities within nine months in January.     The system has come under severe strain as funds have flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMS currency, the West German mark, sending it soaring against weaker currencies in the system.     But Eyskens said February\\'s agreement between leading western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels was working and this would allow the EC to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the EMS.     He told a news conference yesterday\\'s meeting agreed on the need for closer coordination among EMS member governments of interest rate policies and of interest rate differentials between different countries.     They also agreed they needed better coordination of exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable, both when they reached their fixed EMS limits and within their agreed margins.     But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in Luxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC\\'s Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors.     He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economic convergence betwen Community countries and it was important that interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange rates and inflation rates.     The Belgian minister, whose country presently holds the presidency of the community, made clear the meeting had not produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing the EMS towards the EC\\'s long term goal of economic and monetary integration.     \"We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal functioning of the system,\" Eyskens said.     Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMS has to be reinforced if the EC\\'s plans to liberalise all movements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to go ahead.     EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told the meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final phase of capital market liberalisation in October that would include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the move would create difficulties.     Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also discussed the need to \"dedramatise\" realignments of EMS parities by letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out by telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers.     However, West German sources said Bonn Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea.     British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told journalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater coordination of exchange market intervention was the question of which currencies should be used to intervene and held in central bank reserves.     He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS would work better if central banks held each other\\'s currencies -- an issue of particular importance regarding West Germany since the Bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves.     He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignments reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the January reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory.    The realignment was marked by acrimony between France and West Germany, with each side blaming the other for strains in the system that forced the parity overhaul.  REUTER '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said.     Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd, the IEA said in its Monthly Oil Market Report.     Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels, as in 1986. But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year\\'s 3.6 pct, it said.     The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices stay close to current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected. If that happens, natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, and there may be slightly less growth in transport fuels.     IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes, representing 98 days of forward consumption. This is about the same level as at the begining of the year.     The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks.     It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March.     It is possible that final data will show a larger draw, particulary for March, it said. As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.     Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986. Governments built up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the period.     The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising, more or less in line with consumption, after declining for five years, the IEA noted.     Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 214 mln tonnes on January 1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively.     Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April 1, down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption.     World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986.     This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February/March from 16.5 mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally-planned Economies, the IEA said.     Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first quarter, plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs, compared with 17.3 mln bpd of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average for the whole of 1986. Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 mln bpd, against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986.     A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said.     Saudi Arabia\"s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd.  REUTER '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'The U.S. economy in March improved at a faster rate than in February, with the National Association of Purchasing Management\\'s composite index rising to 53.9 pct from 51.9 pct, the NAPM said.     The first quarter average for the index also was 53.9 pct. The NAPM said that, if this average were to continue for the rest of 1987, it would be consistent with real gross national product growth of about three pct.     An index reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase. One below 50 pct implies a declining economy.     The NAPM said the economic improvement was evident in all of the indicators in the index except inventories, which declined slightly.     New orders rose sharply in March, with production also higher. Vendor deliveries slowed, another sign that the economy improved in March. Employment expanded for the first time since August 1984.     Robert Bretz, chairman of the NAPM\\'s business survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc <PBI> said \"the economy ended the first quarter with a healthy, if not substantial improvement.\"     Bretz said the sharp rise in the growth of new orders in March assures a good beginning for the second quarter.     Some 50 pct of the purchasing managers reported that they were paying higher prices in March than at the end of 1986. Of those paying higher prices now, the average increase was put at 2.5 pct.     The estimated average price increase anticipated by members for the remainder of 1987 is 2.1 pct. While prices continue to rise, the NAPM said that most purchasers do not see them as being significant.     The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure, based on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders, production, vendor deliveries, inventories and employment.     The monthly report is based on questions asked of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies.  Reuter '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'U.S. Bond trading is likely to remain cautious in the near term with a possible downward price bias as market participants focus on trends in the dollar, the economy and Federal Reserve policy, economists said.     Most expect the economy to continue showing modest gains, that the dollar has more room to fall and that the Fed will keep policy essentially steady, perhaps for several months.     Until trends are clearer, \"the market can only attempt to to establish and hold a new trading range at higher interest rates,\" said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.     Merrill Lynch economists Raymond Stone and Ward McCarthy said that while the fundamentals generally bode for a healthy investment climate, the market will have no confidence in this environment until there is illumination of and confidence in U.S. Dollar/trade policy.     Salomon Brothers\\' Henry Kaufman said the bond market, highly sensitized to dollar movements, could be encouraged if currency markets seem to be stabilizing or if U.S. And overseas economic growth is perceived as slowing sharply.     \"The crucial question, however, is how soon either of these developments is likely to occur,\" Kaufman said.     \"Market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio manager confidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a while longer,\" said Philip Braverman, chief economist at Irving Securities Corp.     However, Braverman said that, \"from a longer term perspective, current (bond) prices provide a buying opportunity.\"     Despite a nearly one-point bond price rebound Friday on unexpectedly weak March employment data, key 30-year Treasury bonds lost 2-1/4 points in price for the week as a whole and Thursday\\'s 7.93 pct closing yield was a 1987 high.     Braverman said historical evidence suggests that a long bond yield in the 7.93 pct area provides a basis for optimism. Bonds closed at 7.86 pct on Friday.     The Irving economist noted that three times last year, in a similar \"paroxysm of pessimism,\" the key bonds reached a similar closing yield high. Within three to six weeks in each instance, however, Braverman said bond prices recovered to bring the yield down sharply by 63 to 82 basis points.     Mitchell Held of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc said that many portfolio managers now believe yields could approach nine pct by midyear, which he considers unlikely.     Held said that, since late 1986, Smith Barney analysts have spoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher and they continue to believe that an upward bias is likely to persist over the next few months.     Held said that in conversations with portfolio managers last week there appeared to be increasing belief that the rate rise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct by midyear. Naturally, that would mean a sharp bond price fall.     \"Yields could rise further over the next few months, but the rise should be less than the 65 basis point rise we\\'ve seen since the start of the year,\" Held said.     Most expect Fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term.     \"The Fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance,\" said economists at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc.     They said the Fed cannot tighten policy and push up interest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollar and head off renewed inflationary psychology. That might harm the fragile U.S. Economic expansion.     The Lanston economists said, \"The Fed cannot ease its policy stance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calm domestic and Third World debt jitters without the threat of causing a further decline in the dollar.\"     Minutes of February\\'s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting released Friday showed that while the FOMC left policy unchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policy later if conditions in the economy, foreign exchange or credit markets warranted a policy shift.     However, economists generally believe that continued fairly sluggish U.S. Economic growth and the financial strains on U.S. Banks resulting from their problem loans to developing countries rule out any Fed policy firming.     There is broad agreement among economists that the FOMC at last Tuesday\\'s meeting also left Fed policy unchanged.     This week\\'s U.S. Economic data are expected to have little impact. February consumer instalment credit numbers are due on Wednesday, with March producer price data out Friday.     There may be mild relief in some quarters that the U.S. Purchasing Managers Composite Index, a closely-watched economic indicator, rose only to 53.9 pct in March from 51.9 pct. A Friday rumor had put the number far higher. The index\\'s first quarter average also was 53.9 pct, translating into real GNP growth of about three pct if continued through 1987.     Federal funds traded at 5-15/16 pct late Friday and are expected to open about there today with no Fed action seen.  REUTER '},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'Caesars World Inc <CAW> said its directors unanimously approved a recapitalization plan under which stockholders will get a cash distribution of 25 dlrs per share via a one-time special cash dividend and will retain their common stock ownership in Caesars World.     Caesars World said it expects to raise the approximately one billion dlrs needed to pay the 25 dlr per share dividend and the expenses of recapitalization through around 200 mln dlrs in bank borrowings and a public sale of approximately 800 mln dlrs of debt. Some outstanding debt will be retired.     Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, Caesars\\' financial advisor, has told the company it is confident it can arrange the entire financing needed for the recapitalization.     Henry Gluck, chairman and chief executive officer of the hotel, casino and resorts company, said in a statement the board believes the recapitalization plan is financially superior to a 28 dlr a share tender offer by Martin Sosnoff.     Gluck said the Caesars World board once again recommends that shareholders reject the Sosnoff offer.     The stock closed at 29.25 dlrs a share on Friday.     \"Our ability to restructure along these lines is possible primarily because of the financial stability and the strong operating results achieved by management in recent years,\" Gluck said.     He said that after the recapitalization takes effect, proforma net income for the fiscal year ended July 31, 1988 is expected to be about 28.7 mln dlrs.     Fiscal 1988 primary earnings per share are projected to be 76 cents, based on about 37.8 mln in post-recapitalization common and common-equivalent shares outstanding.     Commenting on the company\\'s longer term earnings outlook, Gluck said \"we project net income to increase to 86.2 mln dlrs in 1992, reflecting increased operating income and lower interest expense due to the retirement of 267 mln dlrs of debt incurred in connection with the recapitalization.\"     He said the company does not usually release projections, but has done so now beause of the significance of the recapitalization.     Gluck said the recapitalization plan will be submitted for stockholder approval at a special meeting expected in June.     The plan will require the approval of stockholders and that of the Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulatory authorities.     As part of the plan, the company will change its state of incorporation from Florida to Delaware by means of a merger of Caesars World into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company.     The new incorporation certificate and bylaws will provide for, among other things, a \"fair price\" provision requiring that certain transactions with interested 15 pct stockholders be approved by an 80 pct vote of stockholders, excluding shares held by such interested stockholders.     Caesars World said in a statement that \"the cash distribution will result in a substantial deficit in stockholders\\' equity.\" It did not give an estimate of the size of this deficit.     But the company said its financial advisors have said they believe that after the recapitalization, Caesars World should have the financial flexibility and resources necessary to finance its current and projected operating and capital requirements.

              "  'BODY': \"Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986, the International Energy Agency said.     Oil use in the 24 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) increased by around one pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels a day, the IEA said in its latest monthly report.     Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels, as was the case in 1986. But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986, the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year's 3.6 pct.     The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain nar current levels, some destocking by end-users can be expected.     If that takes place, natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986, it said.     IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes, or 98 days of forward consumption. This is about the same as at the begining of the year.     The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks.     Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender 1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986.     The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with company stocks rising, more or less in line with consumption, after declining for five years, IEA said.     Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January one and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption, respectively.     Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes, down from the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption.     The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year. This followed a small rise in January of 400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd in March.     And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw, particulary for March, it said.     As crude production also fell, there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks, particularly at sea, the IEA said.     World oil supply fell through the first quarter by about two bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986.     This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 bpd in February/March from 16.5 bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from Centrally Planned Economies, the IEA said.     Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the first quarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three months of 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd as against 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period.     A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline, the IEA said.  Reuter \"},\n",

But the markets are signalling the dollar\\'s floor may be far below its level at the time the Paris agreement was struck, the sources said.     Monetary sources also said the dollar\\'s recent sharp fall against the yen reflected the U.S.-Japanese dispute over semi-conductor trade which resulted in U.S. Tariffs on certain Japanese electronic goods.     One of the sources said the dispute has to some extent soured the atmosphere ahead of the meetings.     Congressional sentiment for protectionist measures, aimed particularly at Japan, has strengthened, the sources said.  REUTER '},\n",

It was the second production sharing contract signed by Pertamina this year. Three contracts were awarded in 1986.     The agreement, signed at a public ceremony in the presence of Energy Minister Subroto, calls for the standard oil production split of 85-15 pct in Pertamina's favour.     Hong Kong-based Enim Oil is contracted to spend 120 mln dlrs over the next six years, including 10 mln in the first two years.     The 1,137 sq km Lematang block is located between two oil producing sectors of South Sumatra, and Enim officials said there is a good chance of getting a high return on investment.     A spokesman said the area, which has not been drilled before, was neglected because it is deeper than surrounding blocks. He said new developments in seismic techniques have now made seismic survey possible.     The agreement is similar to a production-sharing contract Pertamina signed with Occidental Petroleum Corp in February.     Gas produced will be divided 70-30 pct in Pertamina's favour with operational costs deducted.     Pertamina can market at least 50 pct of Enim Oil's production share, and Enim must give up 10 pct of its interest in the block to an appointed Indonesian company if it finds oil.     Enim must also set aside 28.57 pct of its crude for refining in Indonesia if its share exceeds 150,000 barrels a day.  REUTER \"},\n",

              "  'BODY': 'Japanese oil traders generally expect oil prices to remain steady through June, when the next Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries\\' (Opec) meeting is scheduled to take place.     Prices have kept to a narrow trading range for more than a month, despite coming under considerable pressure in February as Japanese oil companies holding high oil stocks strongly resist paying official prices, trade sources said.     Despite these attempts, spot crude rose steadily to stabilize around OPEC\\'s 18 dlr a barrel target, they said.     Spot prices fell more than two dlrs during the month, mainly on market assumptions Opec was producing more than its 15.8 mln barrel a day (bpd) self-imposed ceiling and members would submit to pressure to discount prices, oil traders said.     However, Opec\\'s discipline in holding its price and output targets eventually forced many of the buyers back, they said.     Countries such as Qatar, Iran and Iraq refused to bend to demands for lower prices in spite of threats of non-lifting from Japanese buyers.     The solidarity of Opec encouraged Qatar to charter vessels to store its production rather than cut its prices, they said.     Opec\\'s March production was 14.6 mln bpd, 1.2 mln below its ceiling, with Saudi Arabia\\'s output just below 3.0 mln bpd compared to its Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd, the Middle East Economic Survey estimated.     \"Of course there was a little cheating but not enough to destroy the market,\" an oil trader in Tokyo said.     Opec crudes have been appearing on the spot market at discounted prices through barter deals and the swapping of Middle East grades for North Sea cargoes, but these trades have not generated sufficient volume to depress the market, he said.     The current spot values of Middle East grades are only 20 to 25 cts below official prices, so resistance to buying crude under term contracts in the second quarter is likely to be weaker, traders said.     Indonesia\\'s Minister of Energy and Mines Subroto said today OPEC faces the choice of either maintaining present output volume at 15.8 mln bpd and seeing prices increase slightly, or raising the production ceiling so members can produce more in the third and fourth quarters of 1987.

              "  'BODY': 'The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying operations in the next few weeks, cocoa traders said.     Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices significantly, given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging the market. The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the ICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1,578.03 Special Drawing Rights (SDR) per tonne, below the 1,600 \"must buy\" level.     Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last month by the ICCO council. Buying will begin once the buffer stock manager has completed preparations, traders said.     Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer stock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months used to calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average above the 1,600 SDR \"must buy\" level.     The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of the second, third and fourth positions on the London and New York futures markets. The daily price was 1,577.61 SDR per tonne yesterday.     Months used currently for the indicator are May, July and September, but these are set to change to July, September and December on April 15, prior to May becoming the New York spot month, traders noted.     The introduction of December into the calculations may lift the daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75 stg above May on the London terminal market.     But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the higher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average, the indicator which governs his activities, traders said.     \"The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the implications of delaying until forward prices lift the indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa,\" an analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said.     Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000 tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts. If purchases reach this level within six months, buying is suspended pending an ICCO council review of price ranges. But some cocoa market watchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent forecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mln to two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to three mln.     A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 1986/87 world surplus to between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes, compared with a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of 94,000 tonnes, traders said.     In these circumstances, the buffer stock may only need to buy between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes to lift prices above the \"must buy\" level.     But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock manager can remove cocoa from the market.     The buffer stock system of price differentials set according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from non-members could limit the buffer stock\\'s scope for action, dealers said.     Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is nearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin.     But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as Malaysia is not an ICCO member, while purchases of nearby cocoa can only reach 40 pct in any one day, which forces the buffer stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material.     Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-member cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material, traders said.     Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact on futures, but is likely to widen physical market premiums for this cocoa over futures.     Ghana\\'s premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer stock buying, dealers said.     \"The buffer stock may not help the terminal market, but will provide a backstop for quality cocoas,\" one trader said.     Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer stock were \"all prognostication\" and that no one could hope to predict accurately what the result would be. Psychologically buffer stock buying should help prices, but since the buffer stock already holds a carryover of 100,000 tonnes from the previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus, dealers expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure.     In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding scheme as an additional market support mechanism.  REUTER '},\n",

Dealers said dollar trading was very quiet over the European morning, with operators made wary by today\\'s meeting of the Group of Five finance ministers and central bank chiefs ahead of the full IMF/World Bank session in Washington.     It was undermined by remarks from U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Beryl Sprinkel who told Iowa bankers the U.S. Had no objective regarding the value of the dollar.     Sprinkel also called the reference to stabilizing exchange rates at about current levels, made at the Paris meeting on February 22, a \"vague statement,\" casting doubt on operators\\' assumptions that a secret target level had been set.     Sprinkel added that if West Germany and Japan made progress to stimulate their economies as the Paris agreement envisaged, \"there would not be the necessity of significant declines in the dollar.\"     One dealer for a U.S.-based bank noted the dollar tended easier after the remarks. \"They were obviously regarded as being negative. And if the market starts regarding anything that comes out negatively then it means that the underlying sentiment is negative,\" he said.     Some early selling pressure softened the dollar\\'s undertone.     Most operators overlooked intervention by the Bank of Japan to support the dollar against selling in favour of the yen by institutional investors and overseas operators, dealers said.     After the strong focus on the dollar/yen rate in recent weeks up to the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31, interest and activity was likely to switch, dealers said.     \"We can start to look at a point in time where the interest shifts away from dollar/yen and more into dollar/mark and the other European currencies,\" the U.S. Bank dealer said.

The mark gained some strength from news the Bundesbank set a new securities repurchase tender to add money market liquidity at a fixed 3.80 pct, unchanged from those over the last several weeks. Some expectation had been growing that it might cut the rate or move to a minimum interest rate tender, signalling a desire for a slight easing in credit policy.     Bundesbank central bank council member Lothar Mueller said the Bundesbank had not given up its focus on money supply. A monetary policy which took into account exchange rates and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange-rate oriented policy, he said, contradicting some growing sentiment.     Sterling eased a touch to 2.950 marks at the fixing from 2.957. The yen\\'s unabated strength, despite the intervention, brought it up to 1.2555 marks per 100 from yesterday\\'s 1.2480.     The Swiss franc rose to a fix of 120.515 marks per 100 from 120.180. The French franc eased to 30.055 marks per 100 after 30.060, Belgian franc was little changed at 4.829 marks per 100.

Kuranari said he wants everyone in the telecommunications dispute, including Cable and Wireless, to be satisfied.     Howard told reporters that Britain was actively considering possible retaliatory measures if it did not get its way on the telecommunications issue.     \"There are measures which are under consideration if we continue to suffer from the imbalance in our trading relations,\" he added, but gave no details.

              "  'BODY': \"Malaysian and Indonesian palm oil production is likely to drop sharply this year, due to lower yields, the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.     The publication expects total Malaysian output during Jan/Sept 1987 to decline by eight pct to 3.05 mln tonnes. For East Malaysia, it put production during the period at 297,000 tonnes after 312,000 a year earlier and for West Malaysia 2.75 mln compared with just over 3.0 mln during Jan/Sept 1986.     It said new plantings had slowed markedly in both countries, but the effects of this will not be felt until 1988-90.     Above normal yields during recent years resulted in trees reacting to the stress by changing the sex ratio to more male inflorescences and/or aborting more female, Oil World said.     Yields per hectare are also likely to be adversely affected this year by insufficient rain up to 25 months ago. This could especially affect trees in West Malaysia during April/June, while in East Malaysia the impact will be in February/April and July/Dec, and in Indonesia July/Sept.     Last year's cut in fertilizer use will hit this year's yields and bigger effects are expected within the next three years, Oil World said without elaborating.     Opening stocks in West Malaysia at the start of this year were put at only 565,000 tonnes compared with 914,000 in January 1986, Oil World said.     West Malaysian net exports are therefore expected to drop 500,000 tonnes to 2.54 mln during Jan/Sept, while those of East Malaysia are likely to decline by 10 pct to 280,000 tonnes.     Indonesian palm oil production is forecast to fall about eight pct during Jan/May, but to rise from June on. Overall Indonesian output during Jan/Sept is forecast to rise three pct to 933,000 tonnes. Indonesian stocks as of April 1, however, are put at only 65,000 tonnes compared with 160,000 a year ago.     Indonesian export commitments and domestic requirements are both running at high levels, Oil World said, and it expects the country's imports to reach a record 110,000 tonnes during Jan/Sept. The bulk of this will arrive during Feb/May, ahead of the April elections and the religious Ramadan festival throughout May, it said.     Indonesian net exports, therefore, may fall by 29 pct to 350,000 tonnes, Oil World said. The possibility that recent Indonesian palm oil purchases will not actually enter the country but be transshipped to other countries to fulfill Indonesia's export orders cannot be ruled out, it said.

Ruding told a meeting of the World Trade Forum here that protectionism would naturally lead to retaliation and aggravate the problems of heavily indebted developing countries.     \"The main contribution towards resolving the still enourmous U.S. trade deficit is not repeat not a further fall in the dollar, is not still more protectionism in your country.\"     \"No, it is - like in other countries - changes in domestic economic and financial policies,\" Ruding said.     Ruding said he was less worried about a crisis of the weakening dollar than he was in January before the Paris accord to stabilize foreign exchange rates.     He said the highest priority should be given to policy changes in the United States, especially reducing the budget deficit and encouraging domestic savings.     But he said other countries, such as Japan and West Germany, also needed to take greater steps toward reducing their trade surpluses.  Reuter '},\n",
