## ML_ex3 - "3.2.3: Next-word prediction (Language Modelling) using Deep Learning"

### DATA - "Reuters-21578" - http://www.daviddlewis.com/resources/testcollections/reuters21578/
The data was originally collected and labeled by Carnegie Group, Inc. and Reuters, Ltd. in the course of developing the CONSTRUE text categorization system.

## TASK:
- Submit: report/presentation, data, Jupyternotebook,
- A zip file with all needed files (your source code, your code compiled, data sets used (but NOT the ones we provide to you), a build script that resolves dependencies, or include any libraries you are using. Your submission needs to be self-contained!
- Dedicated panel in the report and in JN: a short how-to explaining the way to start your program (which is the main file, which command-line options does it expect).
- Make sure dependencies are either packaged along, or are easily resolved (build file, virtual environment, etc., whatever applicable for your approach)
- Report:
  - Your solutions (also describe failed approaches!)
  - Your results, evaluated on different datasets, parameters, ...
  - An analysis of the results

- Hyperparameters:
  - Size of the training data
  - Number of words in sequence
  - Number of Epochs
  - => Accuracy based on pre-defined sentences
  - => Runtime

## OPEN TOPICS:
- Is there any further hint which was shared on discussion forum?
- The report should be ppt or Word like?
- What is the expected length of the report / ppt?
- ...
